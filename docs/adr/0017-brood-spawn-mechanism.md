# Brood spawn uses detached tmux sessions, explicit worktree creation, and two-pass injection

**Status:** accepted — 2026-05-30

ADR-0007 deferred the brood SPAWN MECHANISM. The first real launch exposed that `claude --worktree --tmux` is unusable from a non-TTY Bash tool context and mangles branch names; this ADR records the mechanism that replaced it.

## Context

Five root-cause failures emerged at first launch:

1. `claude --tmux` requires a real terminal; the Bash tool provides none → "open terminal failed: not a terminal".
2. `claude --worktree <NAME>` derives `worktree-<NAME>` as the branch name and mangles slash-separated names — never the intended strain branch.
3. Foreground `claude --tmux` never returns; a sequential spawn loop hung on strain #1.
4. Detached children have no human to approve Claude Code permission prompts.
5. `printf '%q' | tmux send-keys` mangled multi-line task strings.

## Decision

1. **Worktree creation:** `git worktree add -b <exact-strain-branch> <path> <base>`. The `base` input (resolved trunk SHA/ref) is passed by the hatchery and recorded in the brood manifest; worktrees branch off it exactly.
2. **Session launch:** `tmux new-session -d` (detached) running `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --settings '{"skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt":true}'`. The detached session supplies a PTY. The settings injection pre-accepts the one-time "Bypass Permissions mode" trust gate non-interactively, avoiding screen-scraping.
3. **Spawn topology:** two-pass — pass 1 launches all strain sessions in parallel; pass 2 polls each session for readiness then injects its task.
4. **Task injection:** each strain task is written to a temp file; delivered via `tmux load-buffer <file>` + `paste-buffer` + Enter. Bypasses send-keys quoting entirely.
5. **Readiness detection:** `tmux capture-pane` polled until the pane contains the string `hivemind:overlord` (READY_TIMEOUT=90 s, POLL_INTERVAL=2 s).
6. **Cleanup split:** hard failures before launch → kill session + remove worktree; post-launch timeout/inject failures → leave session alive, mark strain `failed` in manifest (recoverable by user).

## Considered Options

| Option | Rejected because |
|---|---|
| `claude --worktree <NAME> --tmux` directly | Requires a TTY the Bash tool cannot provide; mangles branch names |
| Foreground serial spawn | Blocks on strain #1 indefinitely; no parallel boot |
| Screen-scrape the bypass-permissions gate + keystroke injection | Brittle TUI coupling; the settings key `skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt` is a stable contract |
| `tmux send-keys` with `printf '%q'` escaping | Mangled multi-line prompts; quoting complexity grows with prompt content |

## Consequences

- ONE remaining TUI coupling: the `hivemind:overlord` ready-detection substring. If the overlord prompt changes, READY_TIMEOUT exhausts before injection. This is a documented maintenance point.
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` widens child blast radius (consistent with ADR-0007: unattended children run the full standard pipeline with no human in the loop).
- New `base` input on `spawn-brood` and top-level `base` field in the brood manifest.
- Naming is now deterministic: tmux session `brood-<short-id>`, worktree `.claude/worktrees/<short-id>`.

## Amendment — 2026-05-30 (PR #154)

The bypass-mode blast radius above interacts with untrusted input: a strain task description may be sourced from a GitHub issue body and pasted into the child prompt, while the detached child has no interactive permission gate. Two compensating controls now mitigate the brood injection surface (defense-in-depth), plus a structural backstop:

1. **Data-boundary preamble in `task.md`** — `hivemind:spawn-brood` prepends the canonical external-content data-boundary preamble above the description payload (inside the same heredoc), so it is injected ahead of every strain description.
2. **Pre-spawn human approval of normalized task text** — the overlord brood gate (`overlord.md` steps 3a/3b) surfaces the normalized `{name, description}` task text to the human for explicit approval before spawn; with no downstream permission prompt, this approval is the injection gate.

Partial structural backstop (scoped to product-file mutation): the child is itself a delegating overlord whose `tools:` carry no `Write`/`Edit`, so embedded instructions that would mutate product files still route through branch → checkpoint → review → PR rather than direct file writes (Write-Capable Skill Containment, `plugin/governance/security-policy.md`). It does NOT contain all execution — the child holds `Bash` and runs `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, so a surviving injected instruction could drive Bash directly; the three compensating controls (preamble, human approval, allowlist) remain the real boundary. Status remains accepted.

## Amendment — 2026-05-30 (PR #154, I/O-primitive change)

The brood file writes (`task.md` and `manifest.yaml`) migrate from shell heredoc to the **Write tool**. Embedding untrusted text in heredoc syntax was the wrong primitive: `cat > file <<"$DELIM"` does NOT parameter-expand the delimiter word `$DELIM` (a quoted heredoc word is taken literally), so the "per-call random delimiter" scheme never actually randomized — the literal token `$DELIM` was the real delimiter on every spawn, and a payload line equal to the literal `$DELIM` would terminate the heredoc early and execute the subsequent lines in the hatchery shell. This is the same injection class the random-delimiter scheme was meant to close.

Decision:

1. **Write tool for both files.** `task.md` and `manifest.yaml` are each written with a single Write tool call. Write performs no shell parsing of untrusted bytes, eliminating the heredoc-delimiter injection class entirely (no delimiter to collide with, no path to hatchery-shell execution). The Write tool emits no chat text, so Silence Discipline is preserved (it is a permitted non-final tool call; the final routing/exit Bash call still follows).
2. **YAML validity is assured by the block-scalar discipline, not the removed delimiter.** Every manifest scalar derived from planner output, issue text, or a filesystem path is emitted as a YAML literal block scalar (`|`); only fixed-shape trusted literals stay inline. The sole residual YAML-authoring rule: an embedded newline inside an untrusted value must be reproduced indented to the block scalar's content indent. Refinement (2.17.5): exact-value fields (`name`, `branch`, `base`, `worktree_path`) use `|-` (strip chomping) so the parsed value has no trailing newline, and `hivemind:brood-status` double-quotes every manifest value it interpolates into a shell command — block scalars give YAML-injection safety, `|-` gives exact values, consumer quoting gives shell safety.
3. **P1 linked-worktree exclude-path fix.** Pre-flight 1f's repo-local exclude path is now resolved via `git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude` instead of a hardcoded `<repo_root>/.git/info/exclude`, which is wrong in a linked git worktree (`<repo_root>/.git` is a gitdir-pointer FILE, not a directory) — a supported context under recursive brood (a spawned child overlord spawning from a worktree).

Considered and rejected: a TRUE YAML serializer (`python3 -c 'import yaml; yaml.safe_dump(...)'` or `yq`). Rejected because (a) it adds a runtime dependency not guaranteed on consumers, and (b) passing untrusted input into a `-c` program reintroduces the same injection class unless the values are first written to files — which is the Write-tool primitive again. The Write tool is therefore the correct and sufficient primitive; the serializer fallback is recorded here only and is NOT placed in the SKILL body.

The prior amendment's "inside the same heredoc" phrasing for the `task.md` preamble is superseded by the Write-tool primitive (recorded here as an append; prior text is left intact). Status remains accepted.

## Amendment — 2026-05-30 (PR #154, shell-injection class closure)

Prior fixes leaned on "double-quote every dynamic token" as the shell-safety story. That is wrong: **double-quoting is not a shell-safety encoding.** When untrusted LITERAL bytes appear in the SOURCE of a command the agent hands to the Bash tool, bash command substitution `$(...)`, backticks, and `${}` STILL expand even inside double quotes. `git check-ref-format --branch` ACCEPTS branches like `feat/x$(touch${IFS}/tmp/pwn)`, so emitting `git check-ref-format --branch "feat/x$(touch...)"` runs `touch` before git ever validates the ref. Quoting stops only word-splitting and globbing.

Decision (closes the entire shell-injection class on `branch`/`base`):

1. **Agent-reasoning allowlist gate (primary).** `hivemind:spawn-brood` adds an **Input Validation Gate** applied by the agent in its OWN reasoning — the model matches each `branch`/`base` value against the literal rule `^[A-Za-z0-9._/-]+$` (non-empty, not starting with `-`, no `..`) BEFORE any Bash call, so raw untrusted bytes NEVER enter generated shell source. Only an already-clean value is ever placed into a (still double-quoted) shell token. The charset excludes every shell-special byte while keeping real branches valid (`feat/x.y`, `release/1.2.3`, `bugfix/foo-bar`).
2. **Derived values safe-by-construction.** `short` (sanitized `[a-z0-9-]`), `worktree_path` (`<repo_root>/.claude/worktrees/<short>`), and `tmux_session` (`brood-<short>`) carry no untrusted bytes and need no gate; they are quoted as defense-in-depth only.
3. **brood-status re-gates the manifest branch.** `hivemind:brood-status` re-applies the SAME allowlist (in agent reasoning) to every manifest value before its first shell use, skipping a strain's probes and reporting `blocked (branch failed safety allowlist)` on failure while continuing other strains. Defense in depth — the consumer does not trust the manifest file even though spawn-brood's gate should have prevented an unsafe value.
4. **`check-ref-format` demoted to defense-in-depth.** It runs AFTER the gate as ref-SHAPE validation on an already-safe value; it is never the shell-safety boundary (it accepts injection-bearing names).

Considered and rejected as PRIMARY: the out-of-band approach (Write-then-`cat`, or read into a shell variable referenced only as `"$var"`, which is inert because bash does not re-evaluate command substitution from variable contents). Recorded as a documented fallback only — rejected as primary because no real branch needs a forbidden byte, and clean rejection of a hostile name beats faithful execution of it. Status remains accepted.

## Amendment — 2026-05-30 (PR #154, behavior-preserving structural refactor)

The deterministic shell that `hivemind:spawn-brood` previously hand-templated in
its SKILL.md body is extracted into one committed script,
`plugin/skills/spawn-brood/scripts/spawn-brood.sh`. Same inputs produce identical
worktrees, sessions, manifest, and exit codes — no observable-behavior change.

Decision:

1. **File-based Write-tool inputs parsed by jq into inert variables.** The agent
   authors a single JSON inputs file (`.hivemind/brood/inputs.json`) with the
   Write tool; the script parses it with `jq` into shell variables referenced only
   as `"$var"`. This makes the command-substitution injection class STRUCTURALLY
   closed by architecture rather than per-snippet quoting: untrusted bytes never
   enter generated command source, and bash does not re-evaluate command
   substitution from variable contents. The round-7 allowlist gate is retained in
   the script as defense-in-depth ref-shape validation, no longer load-bearing.
2. **`jq` is now a required runtime dependency** (READ-only, for inputs parsing).
   The script blocks with a verbose `blocker: jq is required …` + exit 1 if
   absent, alongside the existing `tmux`/`claude` checks. ADR-0017's earlier
   rejection of a true YAML serializer for manifest WRITING still holds — manifest
   emission stays `printf` block-scalar.
3. **SKILL.md slimmed to a ~4-step navigator with the inputs schema inline.** The
   skill body is now ~4 imperative steps (build inputs → Write file → run script →
   interpret exit), and the authoritative inputs schema lives inline in that body.
   The security WHY, three-layer manifest model, block-scalar chomping reasoning,
   and ready-substring maintenance point are documented in this ADR and in the
   script's own header comments — not in a separate doc. The broad `allowed-tools`
   Bash grants collapse to the single precise
   `Bash(bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/spawn-brood/scripts/spawn-brood.sh *)`
   grant plus `Read`/`Write`, matching the `github-review-loop` precedent.

Status remains accepted.

## Amendment — 2026-05-30 (PR #154, filesystem-path out-of-band + tmux paste/buffer hardening)

The round-7 shell-injection closure (allowlist gate) covered `branch`/`base` but left filesystem PATHS treated as "safe-by-construction because `repo_root` came from `git rev-parse`" / "the user's own filesystem path, not in the threat model." That carve-out is SUPERSEDED and was wrong: the checkout DIRECTORY NAME is filesystem-controlled and can legally contain shell metacharacters (a repo cloned under `repo$(touch${IFS}PWNED)`), and command substitution `$(...)`/backticks expand even inside double quotes when those literal bytes appear in command source. Paths cannot be charset-allowlisted (legit paths contain spaces).

Decision (extends the round-7 closure to filesystem paths):

1. **Out-of-band path variables.** `repo_root` and the derived `worktree_path` are NEVER emitted as literal path text into command source. Each shell command derives the path INLINE via command substitution — `rr="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"`, `wt="$rr/.claude/worktrees/<short>"` — whose output is captured into a variable and is then inert (bash does not re-evaluate command substitution from variable contents); the path is referenced only as `"$rr"`/`"$wt"`. The only literal interpolated is `<short>` (already sanitized to `[a-z0-9-]`). Because each Bash tool call runs in a fresh shell, the variable is re-derived within every command that needs it. Applied to every path-bearing shell site (`git worktree add`, the `task.md` parent `mkdir`, Pass-2 `load-buffer`, config-copy `mkdir`/`cp`, HARD-failure `git worktree remove --force`, and the pre-flight worktree-existence test). `worktree_path` is still recorded in the manifest as an absolute path via the Write tool — a tool parameter, no shell, so inert there.
2. **tmux bracketed paste (`paste-buffer -p`).** The task is always multiline (data-boundary preamble + blank line + description); `paste-buffer` without `-p` replaces linefeeds with carriage returns, so the TUI could receive the preamble and each description line as separate Enter-terminated submissions instead of one bounded prompt. `-p` (bracketed paste) injects the whole multiline issue-sourced payload as a single bounded prompt; the explicit `send-keys Enter` still submits it once.
3. **Best-effort named-buffer deletion on inject-failure.** `paste-buffer -d` deletes the per-strain named buffer (`brood-<short>`) only on a SUCCESSFUL paste. A `load-buffer` success followed by a `paste-buffer` failure (child pane exits between readiness and paste) leaves the untrusted issue-sourced task resident on the shared tmux server. Every inject-failure path now best-effort deletes the buffer (`tmux delete-buffer -b "brood-<short>" 2>/dev/null || true`), so an untrusted task never persists in the shared tmux buffer regardless of outcome.

Status remains accepted.

## Amendment — 2026-05-30 (PR #154, Per-brood-id namespaced state)

Prior amendments treated `inputs.json` and `manifest.yaml` as singleton paths per checkout and added a **single-brood model**: a server-global `tmux list-sessions | grep '^brood-'` active-brood guard plus an in-flight `mkdir "$STATE/.spawn-lock"` atomic lock with an `EXIT` trap. That model rejected concurrent broods entirely — two distinct `brood_id`s from the same checkout could not run, and review flagged the lock/guard as the wrong mechanism (a checkout-global lock blocks legitimate parallel broods and a `brood-*` grep cannot distinguish one brood's sessions from another's).

Decision (replaces the single-brood model with per-brood-id namespacing):

1. **`brood_slug` derivation.** A filesystem-safe key is derived from the parsed `brood_id` by mapping every byte outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` to `-` (re-derived from the PARSED `brood_id`, never trusted from the inputs arg path; rejected if it sanitizes empty or contains `..`). It names the per-brood state dir, the manifest sibling, and the tmux session suffix.
2. **Disjoint per-brood state layout.** State moves from singleton `.hivemind/brood/{inputs.json,manifest.yaml}` to per-brood `.hivemind/brood/<brood_slug>/{inputs.json,manifest.yaml}`. Two distinct `brood_id`s resolve to two distinct directories, so concurrent broods — same checkout AND across checkouts — never collide on inputs or manifest state. An inputs-path/slug consistency check (the inputs file's parent-dir basename MUST equal the slug re-derived from `brood_id`) is a defense-in-depth caller-error signal.
3. **Removal of the server-global guard and the mkdir lock.** The `tmux list-sessions | grep '^brood-'` active-brood guard, the `mkdir "$STATE/.spawn-lock"` atomic lock, and its `EXIT` trap are DELETED. They are unnecessary: distinct `brood_id`s touch disjoint directories, so there is nothing for a checkout-global lock or a server-global session grep to protect. Their removal dissolves the review findings (NEW-H1/H2/M1) that the lock/guard mechanism raised — those findings described defects in a mechanism that no longer exists.
4. **Brood-scoped same-brood_id guard.** The only remaining collision a guard must catch is re-spawning the SAME `brood_id` while its own sessions are still live. After `STATE` is set, if `$STATE/manifest.yaml` already exists, its recorded `tmux_session:` values are extracted and probed with `tmux has-session`; any live session blocks (`brood <brood_id> is already active (live session <name>); refusing to overwrite`). If none is live, the stale completed state is overwritten. This guard inspects ONLY this brood's own manifest — never a sibling brood's.
5. **Session naming carries the slug.** The tmux session is renamed `brood-<short>` → `brood-<short>-<brood_slug>`, so sessions from concurrent broods are distinguishable and a brood's own sessions are recoverable from its manifest.
6. **`brood-status` multi-brood discovery.** `hivemind:brood-status` replaces the singleton manifest read with the glob `<main_checkout>/.hivemind/brood/*/manifest.yaml`, runs the existing per-strain probe (and its untrusted-manifest re-gate) per discovered manifest, and emits one labeled status table + summary per brood keyed by `brood_id` (most-recent-first), with a leading `Broods: N active` roll-up line. No matches still reports "No active brood found."

Status remains accepted.

## Amendment — 2026-05-30 (PR #154, concurrency model scoped to option Y)

Local review iteration 3 surfaced three findings in the per-brood-id namespacing above (F1 slug injectivity, F2 worktree/branch namespacing + same-brood in-flight race, F3 brood-status session-name grammar). The scope decision was **option Y (scope down)** over **option X (full same-checkout concurrency)** and **Z (minimal)**.

**Key realization:** cross-checkout concurrent broods (different repos / checkouts) never shared files — `.hivemind/` is per-checkout state, so two checkouts resolve to two disjoint `.hivemind/brood/<slug>/` paths. They only ever collided on server-global tmux session names, which the `brood-<short>-<brood_slug>` session rename (v2.18.0) ALREADY fixed. The only scenario that needs worktree-path/branch namespacing is two SAME-checkout concurrent broods reusing a strain `name` — a rare, low-value case. Option Y therefore rejects same-checkout concurrent broods via one correct atomic reservation rather than paying the surface cost of namespacing the worktree path and branch.

Decision:

1. **F1 — injective slug via UTC canonicalization.** `brood_id` is canonicalized to a single UTC instant before sanitizing: `brood_canon="$(date -u -d "$brood_id" +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ 2>/dev/null || printf '%s' "$brood_id")"`, then the slug is `tr -c 'A-Za-z0-9._-' '-'` on `brood_canon`. Without this, the ISO offsets `+01:00` and `-01:00` both sanitize their offset punctuation to `-`, collapsing two DISTINCT instants to the same slug — and the slug is the per-brood disjointness key. Canonicalizing first makes offset-equivalent timestamps that denote different instants get distinct slugs, and the same instant always get the same slug. `date -d "$brood_id"` passes `brood_id` as an inert quoted ARGUMENT (date parses, never executes it); no command substitution runs on untrusted content. A non-GNU `date` (or a value date rejects) falls back to the raw `brood_id`, which still slugs safely.

2. **F2 dissolved — atomic same-checkout reservation, NO worktree/branch namespacing.** The prior brood-scoped guard probed `$STATE/manifest.yaml` for live `tmux_session:` values AFTER Pass 1+2 wrote the manifest — an in-flight race: two same-`brood_id` spawns both saw no manifest and both launched. It is replaced by a single atomic reservation BEFORE Pass 1/2: `mkdir -p "$STATE"` (idempotent — the agent already created `$STATE` when it wrote `$STATE/inputs.json` via the Write tool, which makes parent dirs), then `mkdir "$STATE/.reservation"` (NON-`-p`) as the gate. `mkdir` is an atomic syscall that fails if the target exists, so exactly one of two racing same-`brood_id` same-checkout spawns wins; the loser fails closed with a clear blocker. **Worktree path and branch are deliberately NOT slug-namespaced** (option X, rejected): namespacing them would let two same-checkout broods co-exist, but that case is rare and low-value, and rejecting it via one atomic reservation is far less surface than threading a slug through every worktree-path/branch derivation, pre-flight collision check, manifest field, and the `brood-status`/cleanup consumers. A stale `.reservation` dir from a crashed spawn is operator-removed (gitignored runtime state).

3. **F3 — brood-status session-name grammar widened to the producer's grammar.** The producer emits `brood-<short>-<brood_slug>` where `brood_slug` is the canonical `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ` form — uppercase `T`/`Z` and possible `.`. `brood-status`'s expected-shape re-validation of `tmux_session` was `brood-[a-z0-9-]+`, which rejects every real session and marks every brood blocked. It is widened to `^brood-[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$` — still a strict allowlist (no shell metacharacters), now matching the emitted grammar.

Status remains accepted.

## Amendment — 2026-05-30 (PR #154, concurrency machinery amputated → single-brood)

The per-brood-id concurrency model became an unbounded local-review rabbit hole. Each review iteration closed findings on the namespacing/lock machinery and immediately opened new ones on the SAME machinery: the slug was not collision-free (F1), the reservation had an in-flight race (F2), the worktree path and branch were un-namespaced (F2 again), and the brood-status session-name grammar rejected the producer's own emitted names (F3). The single use case this machinery served — two SAME-checkout concurrent broods reusing a strain name — is rare and low-value. Per the user decision (Option A), the machinery is DELETED rather than hardened further. Deleting the code dissolves the open findings STRUCTURALLY — the same dissolution move this ADR already used once when it removed the old server-global session guard and the `mkdir .spawn-lock` lock to dissolve the NEW-H1/H2/M1 findings. Cross-checkout broods never share `.hivemind/` state (it is per-checkout), so their manifests, inputs, and worktrees are disjoint without any namespacing. `brood-<short>` tmux session names are server-global and carry no checkout identifier, so two different checkouts each spawning a brood with a same-named strain produce the same session name and collide on the shared tmux server — the same single-namespace trade-off as the rejected same-checkout concurrency. This is accepted under the "one brood at a time per checkout, operator responsibility" stance.

Decision (reverts the per-brood-id model to a singleton single-brood model):

1. **What is removed.** Deleted: the `brood_slug` derivation + UTC canonicalization (`date -u -d "$brood_id" …`), the per-brood-id namespaced state dirs `.hivemind/brood/<brood_slug>/{inputs.json,manifest.yaml}`, the `.reservation` `mkdir` gate, the slug session-name suffix, the inputs-path/slug consistency check, and `brood-status`'s multi-brood `*/manifest.yaml` glob discovery. State reverts to the singleton pair `.hivemind/brood/{inputs.json,manifest.yaml}` anchored to `repo_root`; tmux sessions revert to `brood-<short>`; `brood-status` reverts to reading the single manifest.

2. **Overlap protection — option (b): a single singleton-manifest liveness reject, NOT a `mkdir` reservation.** If the singleton `manifest.yaml` records a `tmux_session` that `tmux has-session` reports live, spawn blocks with `a brood is already active in this checkout (live session <name>); refusing to overwrite`. If the manifest is absent, records no live session, or is malformed, spawn proceeds and overwrites (fail-open to overwrite stale state, matching the existing "stale state is overwritten" stance). This is non-racy by construction relative to the prior machinery: it reads ONE fixed path, so there is no slug to canonicalize, no atomic-reservation TOCTOU window, and no server-global `tmux list-sessions | grep '^brood-'` (itself a prior finding — a `brood-*` grep cannot tell one brood's sessions from another's). The only residual window is two operators racing the very FIRST spawn before any manifest exists; this is documented as operator responsibility — "one brood at a time per checkout." A `mkdir` lock is deliberately not reintroduced: it would only re-add the stale-lock finding this ADR just removed.

3. **Supersession.** The prior amendments "Per-brood-id namespaced state" and "concurrency model scoped to option Y" are SUPERSEDED by this amendment. Their text is left intact above (append-only history), but the singleton single-brood model described here is now authoritative: there is no `brood_slug`, no per-brood-id state dir, no reservation, and no multi-brood discovery. The injection-closure architecture from the earlier amendments (Write-tool inputs, jq-into-inert-variables, out-of-band path derivation, bracketed paste, buffer cleanup) is unaffected and remains in force.

Status remains accepted.

## Amendment — 2026-06-01 (#168: per-brood-id namespacing reinstated structurally; singleton liveness guard removed; manifest v4)

The singleton single-brood model above (the "concurrency machinery amputated" amendment) is SUPERSEDED for the layout/concurrency axis. The earlier per-brood-id attempts were amputated because each review iteration opened new findings on the slug/reservation MACHINERY; the structural fix landed in #168 reinstates per-brood-id namespacing WITHOUT that machinery — a uuidv4 brood-id and disjoint directories replace the slug, the canonicalization, and the lock entirely. The full coherent decision (layout, brood-id format/generation, ground-truth-anchored reads, value-class model) is recorded in **ADR-0021**; this amendment records the SPAWN-side deltas to the mechanism this ADR owns.

Decision:

1. **Per-brood state directory + atomic write.** Brood state moves from the singleton `.hivemind/brood/{inputs,manifest}.json` to a disjoint per-brood directory `.hivemind/broods/<brood-id>/{inputs.json,manifest.json}`, anchored to the canonicalized checkout root. The manifest is written to a temp file UNDER that state dir and `mv`'d into place (same-filesystem atomic rename), so a concurrent reader sees either the old or the complete new manifest, never a torn file. The navigator authors its inputs to a per-invocation mktemp-unique STAGING path under `.hivemind/` (no singleton inputs file to clobber); the script validates it (exists, valid JSON, contained), reads it into inert variables, then atomically `mv`s it into `<state>/inputs.json` for the record.

2. **brood-id generated internally; namespaces every derived name.** The script generates `brood-<uuidv4>` (charset `^brood-[0-9a-f-]+$`, lowercased; portable `uuidgen`/kernel-uuid/`/dev/urandom` chain, fail-closed) and ignores any caller-supplied `brood_id`. The id carries into the branch (`strain/<brood-id>/<short>`, now DERIVED, not caller-supplied), the worktree (`.claude/worktrees/<brood-id>/<short>`), and the tmux session (`<brood-id>-<short>`). The `brood-<short-id>`/`.claude/worktrees/<short-id>` naming in the original Consequences is thereby superseded by the brood-id-prefixed grammar.

3. **Singleton liveness guard REMOVED; NO replacement lock.** The ADR-0017 singleton-manifest liveness reject (and any same-brood in-flight reservation) is deleted. Per-brood-id disjoint directories dissolve both the spawn TOCTOU and the singleton inputs-clobber by construction (ADR-0019 fifth amendment named the singleton layout as the residual; this removes the sharing rather than locking it). Isolation replaces the lock — the same posture as #167. Concurrent same-checkout broods are now supported.

4. **Manifest v4.** `manifest_version: 4`: ADD top-level `brood_id` + `created_at`; per-strain `branch` DERIVED and `worktree_path` retained as DISPLAY-ONLY; DROP `run.suggested_ledger` (the read side derives it from ground truth) and KEEP `run.suggested_id` (lineage reconciliation key). No back-compat (single-user, unreleased 2.20.0): drain any running brood before upgrade.

The injection-closure architecture (Write-tool/staging inputs, jq-into-inert-variables, out-of-band path derivation, bracketed paste, buffer cleanup, canonical-containment + leaf guards) is unaffected and remains in force. This amendment is APPEND-ONLY; prior text stands as history. Status remains accepted.

## Amendment — 2026-06-02 (#170: permission posture — `--permission-mode auto` + config-provisioning evaluated, rejected; `--dangerously-skip-permissions` retained)

Issue #170 proposed switching brood children off `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to `--permission-mode auto` (with attach-on-demand), and optionally provisioning the child `.claude/` config from the trusted coordinator while sanitizing the base tree's `.claude/` before launch (option C). Both were evaluated against live probes this session and REJECTED; the child retains `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Base-trust remains the boundary: broods MUST be spawned only against trusted bases.

Rejection reasons:

1. **`--permission-mode auto` introduces a classifier-model Bash dependency.** Under `auto`, every child Bash operation is gated through a safety-classifier model (`claude-opus-4-8`). When that model is unavailable or rate-limited the child can run NO Bash at all (read-only ops still work) — hit live during evaluation. This is a recurring reliability/throughput/cost dependency, amplified across N concurrent strains.

2. **`auto` does not close the flagged channel.** The P0 channel Codex flagged in #156 — a hostile base's committed `.claude/settings.json` SessionStart hooks, `.claude/hooks/` scripts, and `.mcp.json` MCP declarations — executes at child LAUNCH, before any tool-permission gating. Permission mode gates tool ACTIONS, not hook/MCP startup. So `auto` pays a recurring cost to harden an already-trusted-by-precondition channel while leaving the flagged channel open.

3. **Option C would strip load-bearing config.** The base's committed `.claude/settings.json` carries a load-bearing `enabledPlugins` entry enabling the `hivemind` plugin plus `defaultAgent` set to the `hivemind:overlord` agent — that config is what makes a child boot AS an overlord (the `hivemind:overlord` READY substring). Sanitizing/replacing the base `.claude/` before launch would break the child's boot-as-overlord and thus break every strain. C would only help the out-of-scope untrusted-base case while risking breakage of legitimate trusted-base config.

The folder-trust boot gate under `auto` is NOT itself the blocker: folder-trust inherits to subdirectories, and brood worktrees live inside the already-trusted checkout, so children inherit trust at launch. The blocker is reason 1 (classifier dependency), compounded by reasons 2 and 3.

This amendment is APPEND-ONLY; prior text stands as history. Status remains accepted.
