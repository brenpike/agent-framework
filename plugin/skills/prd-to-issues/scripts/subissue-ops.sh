# subissue-ops.sh — deterministic MECHANISM substrate for the hivemind
# `prd-to-issues` skill (judgment/mechanism split; engineering-principles P5 +
# P11). Path: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/prd-to-issues/scripts/subissue-ops.sh
#
# 1. PURPOSE
# ----------
# This script owns ONLY the lossless, deterministic mechanism of wiring GitHub
# NATIVE sub-issue relationships (the GA 2025 issue hierarchy), so the
# prd-to-issues skill can model a PRD as a PARENT (epic) issue with its sliced
# issues attached as NATIVE SUB-ISSUES — replacing the old `initiative:<slug>`
# label-grouping convention with a first-class GitHub parent/child link.
# NO slicing / judgment logic lives here — deciding WHAT the epic is, how the PRD
# decomposes into slices, or which slice blocks which is holistic LLM work (P11)
# and stays in the SKILL prose. The script is the reproducible hands:
#   - idempotently ensure (create-or-find) the PRD-level epic PARENT issue,
#     returning its issue number + GraphQL NODE ID,
#   - attach a sliced (child) issue to the parent as a NATIVE sub-issue via the
#     GraphQL `addSubIssue` mutation,
#   - read the parent's `subIssues` connection (paginated to completeness),
#   - discover candidate child issues by EXACT title (attached AND unparented) so a
#     create-before-attach partial failure is recoverable, not re-created,
#   - surface a GitHub rejection of an attach (child already parented, cycle) as a
#     STRUCTURED recoverable warning record instead of crashing.
# The split mirrors triage-ops.sh: a thin live `gh`/network shell wrapping a pure,
# offline-exercisable transform core.
#
# 2. INPUT CONTRACT — per subcommand
# ----------------------------------
#   ensure-parent --title <str> --body <str>|--body-file <path|-> [--repo <owner/repo>]
#                 [--existing-number <int>] [--response-file <path|->]
#                 [--discovery-response-file <path|->]
#     Idempotently CREATE-OR-FIND the PRD-level epic (parent) issue — ORPHAN-SAFE
#     (closed-by-construction): when no --existing-number is supplied, ensure-parent first
#     DISCOVERS-BY-TITLE before creating, so a create-before-record partial failure never
#     spawns a SECOND duplicate epic.
#     Idempotency key: if --existing-number is supplied the parent is RESOLVED (its
#     node id read by number) instead of created — the skill anchors the epic to a
#     known issue across re-runs. Otherwise: discover the EXACT epic title via the SHARED
#     ENUMERATION machinery (repository.issues enumeration + paginate_to_completeness +
#     filter_exact_title — the SAME path find-by-title uses, never a divergent copy), then
#     apply the resolution rules below; only on ZERO matches is a NEW issue created.
#     Discovery resolution rules (Q2 DECISION):
#       - exactly ONE OPEN exact-title match  -> RESOLVE it (skip create), status
#         `resolved-by-title`, emit its number+id.
#       - ZERO matches                        -> CREATE as today, status `created`.
#       - MULTIPLE exact matches, OR any CLOSED exact match, OR divergent -> FAIL CLOSED
#         (structured, nonzero) — never blind-create a second parent, never silently reuse a
#         closed epic. The ambiguity is surfaced, not papered over.
#     online (create path): `gh issue create --title --body[-file]` (untrusted title
#              /body flow ONLY through gh flags, never into shell/GraphQL source),
#              then resolve its node id by number via GraphQL. --repo, when given,
#              is passed to gh as `-R`. The PRE-CREATE discovery enumeration applies the SAME
#              owner/repo charset guard find-by-title has (not the weak `*/*` glob).
#     online (resolve path, --existing-number): GraphQL repository.issue(number) read
#              of { number id }, routed through the SHARED kernel (see §4).
#     offline: with --response-file -> normalizes the injected raw GraphQL
#              repository.issue response (number+id) through the shared kernel and
#              emits the parent record (status resolved when --existing-number was given,
#              else created — the create path's post-create node-id read). Title/body/create
#              are NOT exercised offline (no deterministic transform — creation is pure live
#              side effect). With --discovery-response-file (no --existing-number) -> runs the
#              discovery transform (shared kernel + exact-title filter + resolution rules) over
#              the injected repository.issues ENUMERATION response: one OPEN match emits status
#              resolved-by-title; a multiple/CLOSED/divergent set FAILS CLOSED; ZERO matches
#              falls through to the --response-file `created` simulation.
#     --response-file / --discovery-response-file are TEST SEAMS honored ONLY when
#     SUBISSUE_OPS_OFFLINE is set; a live invocation supplying either is REJECTED fail-closed
#     via the shared guard (see §5) BEFORE any gh call.
#
#   attach-subissue --parent-id <NODE_ID> --child-id <NODE_ID> [--response-file <path|->]
#     Run the GraphQL `addSubIssue` mutation. CRITICAL FIELD MAPPING: the input
#     fields are `issueId` (the PARENT) and `subIssueId` (the CHILD). This is
#     DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT from the dependency API's `blockingIssueId` — do NOT
#     conflate the two. Operates on GraphQL NODE IDs (ensure-parent's id + the
#     child issue's id), so no number->id round-trip is needed.
#     online:  addSubIssue mutation, raw response routed through surface_attach_response.
#     offline: with --response-file -> surfaces that injected response (exercises the
#              attached / already-parented / cycle / error / transport records); with
#              --emit-payload (the EXPLICIT opt-in) -> emits the constructed GraphQL
#              variables payload (exercises payload build). Offline with NEITHER flag
#              FAILS CLOSED (exit 2) — symmetric with ensure-parent/list-children, so an
#              ambient SUBISSUE_OPS_OFFLINE leak can never turn a REAL attach into a silent
#              success no-op via a fall-through payload build.
#     --response-file is a TEST SEAM honored ONLY when SUBISSUE_OPS_OFFLINE is set;
#     a live invocation supplying it is REJECTED fail-closed via the shared guard
#     (see §5) BEFORE any gh call.
#     --parent-id / --child-id are validated against the node-id charset (defense-in-depth,
#     ADR-0020) BEFORE any gh/GraphQL use.
#
#   find-by-title --title <str> [--repo <owner/repo>] [--response-file <path|->]
#     DETERMINISTIC orphan/candidate discovery: ENUMERATE the repository's issues and match
#     the EXACT title LOCALLY to find candidate child issues — both ALREADY-ATTACHED (carrying
#     a parent) AND recently-created-but-UNPARENTED issues — so a create-before-attach PARTIAL
#     FAILURE is RECOVERABLE (attach-or-reuse) instead of re-creating a duplicate slice. The
#     skill (RSTEP-002) consumes the output to decide attach-vs-reuse per slice.
#     EXACT-title semantics: the lookup enumerates `repository.issues` (a DETERMINISTIC,
#     terminally-paginated connection — NOT GitHub's fuzzy/ranked full-text search API) and
#     this subcommand POST-FILTERS to issues whose `.title` EQUALS the queried title
#     byte-for-byte (the untrusted title is compared as DATA via jq --arg). The untrusted
#     title NEVER enters a query STRING at all — it flows ONLY through the jq --arg exact-match
#     filter; owner/name flow via gh -f as DATA. There is no search DSL, so no quote-breakout,
#     qualifier-injection, is:issue/PR-leak, or 1000-result truncation class to neutralize.
#     online:  `gh api graphql` enumerates `repository(owner,name).issues(states:[OPEN,CLOSED])`
#              page-by-page to completeness; each raw page is routed through the SHARED kernel
#              (see §4) then the full accumulated set is exact-title post-filtered. Each emitted
#              match carries the issue's `state` (OPEN/CLOSED) — the script SURFACES state
#              truthfully; the closed-child CONFLICT judgment lives in the SKILL, never here.
#     offline: with --response-file -> normalizes the injected raw repository.issues page
#              through the shared kernel + exact-title filter (the injected fixture is the
#              enumeration result set). REQUIRES --response-file offline (fail-closed otherwise).
#     --response-file is a TEST SEAM honored ONLY when SUBISSUE_OPS_OFFLINE is set; a live
#     invocation supplying it is REJECTED fail-closed via the shared guard (see §5) BEFORE
#     any gh call.
#
#   list-children --parent-id <NODE_ID> [--response-file <path|->]
#     Read the parent's `subIssues` connection. PAGINATES TO COMPLETENESS in the
#     live path (first:100 per page, following endCursor while hasNextPage) so the
#     full child set is always returned — this script LEARNS the triage-ops single-
#     page lesson (issue #228): a partial read that drops children past page 1 would
#     let the skill re-attach an already-attached slice or miss a child entirely.
#     online:  one node(id:) subIssues page per cursor; each page's raw response is
#              routed through the SHARED kernel (see §4) BEFORE accumulation — a
#              malformed/error page FAILS CLOSED mid-pagination, never emitting a
#              partial set as if complete.
#     offline: with --response-file -> normalizes the injected raw single-page
#              GraphQL response through the shared kernel. The injected fixture is
#              treated as the COMPLETE connection (its pageInfo.hasNextPage MUST be
#              false; a true value FAILS CLOSED — the offline seam exercises the
#              same completeness gate the live loop enforces).
#     --response-file is a TEST SEAM honored ONLY when SUBISSUE_OPS_OFFLINE is set;
#     a live invocation supplying it is REJECTED fail-closed via the shared guard
#     (see §5) BEFORE any gh call.
#
# 3. OUTPUT SCHEMA — JSON on stdout (compact)
# -------------------------------------------
#   ensure-parent:
#     { "number": <int>, "id": <node-id>,
#       "status": "created"|"resolved"|"resolved-by-title" }
#     `resolved-by-title` is emitted when the pre-create discovery found exactly ONE OPEN
#     exact-title epic and resolved it instead of creating a duplicate (orphan-safety).
#
#   attach-subissue payload (offline, --emit-payload):
#     { "issueId": <parent-node-id>, "subIssueId": <child-node-id> }
#   attach-subissue surfaced response (online, or offline with --response-file):
#     attached: { "status": "attached", "parent": <int>, "child": <int> }
#     warning:  { "status": "warning",
#                 "kind": "already-parented"|"cycle-rejected"|"error"|"transport-error",
#                 "message": <str> }
#
#   list-children normalized:
#     { "parent_id": <node-id|null>,
#       "children": [ { "number": <int>, "id": <node-id>, "title": <str> }, ... ] }
#
#   find-by-title normalized:
#     { "title": <str>,
#       "matches": [ { "number": <int>, "id": <node-id>, "title": <str>,
#                      "state": "OPEN"|"CLOSED",
#                      "parent": { "number": <int>, "id": <node-id> } | null }, ... ] }
#     `matches` holds ONLY issues whose title EQUALS the queried title byte-for-byte
#     (exact-title post-filter). `state` is the issue's GitHub state (OPEN/CLOSED), surfaced
#     truthfully so the skill (PRSTEP-003) can treat a CLOSED exact match as a CONFLICT — the
#     classification JUDGMENT is the SKILL's, never baked into this script. `parent` is null
#     for an UNPARENTED (orphan) candidate and the {number,id} of the parent for an already-
#     attached child — the skill reads it to decide attach (parent null) vs reuse/skip
#     (already attached to the intended epic).
#
# 4. INVARIANTS
# -------------
#   - SINGLE SHARED RESPONSE-SHAPE KERNEL: EVERY live gh/GraphQL read that informs a
#     decision or that is emitted as a result routes through validate_response_shape
#     before any processing. No per-site hand-parsing of response shape is permitted.
#     A non-clean response — transport error (empty/non-JSON), a non-empty `.errors`
#     envelope, null/missing entity at the expected root path, non-array collection,
#     or a null/wrong-typed field on any element — FAILS CLOSED (nonzero, structured
#     kind record to stderr) before any decision or emission. Covered reads:
#     ensure-parent's repository.issue resolve/normalize, list-children's per-page
#     subIssues response (before accumulation). No subcommand bypasses this kernel.
#   - NATIVE SUB-ISSUES, NOT LABELS. This script wires the first-class GitHub
#     parent/child hierarchy; it NEVER reads, writes, or grooms any `initiative:*`
#     (or any other) label. Grouping is the native relationship, full stop.
#   - addSubIssue FIELD MAPPING IS LOAD-BEARING: input `issueId` = the PARENT node,
#     `subIssueId` = the CHILD node. This is NOT the dependency API's
#     `blockingIssueId`. build_attach_payload and the mutation source are the SINGLE
#     SOURCE of this mapping so the two can never diverge.
#   - GraphQL-Features HEADER ON EVERY SUB-ISSUE CALL. Sub-issues are GA (2025) but
#     the GraphQL surface is gated behind `-H "GraphQL-Features: sub_issues"`. EVERY
#     live `gh api graphql` call in this script sends it via the single $GQL_HEADER
#     constant (one source, no per-site divergence). Absent it the API may 404/reject;
#     the script ALWAYS sends it and, if the API STILL rejects, FAILS CLOSED with a
#     clear error — it NEVER silently succeeds or no-ops.
#   - ADD-ONLY. attach-subissue never detaches an existing sub-issue; reparenting /
#     removal is a human decision outside this script.
#   - A GitHub rejection of an attach that is EXPECTED and non-fatal — the child
#     already has a parent, or the link would form a cycle — is surfaced as a warning
#     record (kind already-parented / cycle-rejected) with exit 0, so a batch attach
#     keeps going (slices are independent). EVERY other failure FAILS CLOSED.
#   - PAGINATE TO COMPLETENESS (issue #228 lesson). list-children follows the
#     subIssues connection across ALL pages; a partial read is never emitted as if
#     complete (live: loop on hasNextPage; offline: an injected page asserting
#     hasNextPage==true FAILS CLOSED).
#   - Untrusted issue body/title is DATA: it flows ONLY through `gh issue create`
#     flags (--title / --body / --body-file) and `gh api graphql -f/-F` / jq
#     --arg/--argjson; it is NEVER interpolated into shell source or into GraphQL
#     query source. Node IDs are validated non-empty before use. GraphQL variables
#     are passed via -f/-F, never string-concatenated.
#   - FAIL-CLOSED on malformed injected input to a pure transform (bad --response-file,
#     unreadable injection file, a continued offline page) — a malformed fixture is a
#     usage bug, not noise.
#   - PARENT ORPHAN-SAFETY IS CLOSED-BY-CONSTRUCTION. ensure-parent never blind-creates a
#     second epic: with no --existing-number it DISCOVERS-BY-TITLE first (reusing the SINGLE
#     SHARED ENUMERATION machinery find-by-title uses — repository.issues enumeration +
#     paginate_to_completeness + filter_exact_title, never a divergent second lookup), resolves
#     a lone OPEN exact match (status resolved-by-title), creates ONLY on zero matches, and
#     FAILS CLOSED on a multiple/CLOSED/divergent set rather than duplicating or reusing a
#     closed epic. The same owner/repo charset guard find-by-title enforces is applied to the
#     discovery enumeration path.
#   - TITLE-EXISTENCE IS A DETERMINISTIC ENUMERATION, NOT A FUZZY SEARCH. The title-lookup
#     enumerates `repository.issues` (a terminally-paginated connection) and matches the title
#     LOCALLY as jq --arg DATA. It NEVER feeds the untrusted title into GitHub's ranked
#     full-text `search` API as a query string. This dissolves by construction the whole class
#     of search-as-existence-oracle defects (DSL quote-breakout, qualifier injection,
#     is:issue/PR leak, 1000-result truncation) — there is no query string for the title to
#     break, and the connection has a real terminal page (no relevance cap to guard).
#
# 5. OFFLINE TEST SEAM (STEP-002 depends on this)
# -----------------------------------------------
# Set env SUBISSUE_OPS_OFFLINE to any non-empty value to make EVERY subcommand skip
# ALL gh/network calls and instead drive its pure transform over INJECTED input,
# emitting the deterministic artifact (parent record / attach payload / surfaced
# record / normalized children / title-match candidates) to stdout. Input that would
# normally come from gh is injected via --response-file (ensure-parent, attach-subissue,
# list-children, find-by-title); ensure-parent's PRE-CREATE discovery enumeration is injected via
# the dedicated --discovery-response-file seam (a repository.issues ENUMERATION response, distinct
# from the --response-file repository.issue response); attach-subissue's payload-build artifact instead
# needs the explicit --emit-payload opt-in (offline attach with NEITHER flag FAILS CLOSED). The
# fixture flags are honored ONLY when SUBISSUE_OPS_OFFLINE is set; a live invocation
# supplying any is REJECTED fail-closed (exit 2) BEFORE any gh call via the single
# shared guard reject_fixture_flags_in_live_mode (one mechanism, no per-subcommand
# divergence) — they are test seams, not live caller payloads, and would otherwise let
# a fixture spoof a created/attached/child/resolved-by-title state for a mutation that never
# ran. Use `-` for stdin on any *-file flag. The pure transforms are factored as functions
# reading from injected input (build_attach_payload, surface_attach_response,
# normalize_parent_resolve, normalize_children, normalize_find_by_title, resolve_discovery) so
# the test can drive each directly via the offline CLI with only jq + bash, no `gh`. Mirrors
# triage-ops.sh's --response-file injection.
