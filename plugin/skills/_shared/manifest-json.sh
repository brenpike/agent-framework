# shellcheck shell=bash
#
# manifest-json.sh — shared brood-manifest field extractor (read side of spawn-brood.sh).
#
# THIS FILE IS SOURCED, NOT EXECUTED. No shebang: each caller sources it by absolute
# path derived from its OWN script_dir (`. "$plugin_root/skills/_shared/manifest-json.sh"`).
# It defines functions only; it runs no top-level statements and changes no caller state
# beyond defining the functions below. `bash -n` validates it as a sourced fragment.
#
# SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY: extract scalar fields from the JSON brood manifest with jq. The
# manifest is the same JSON spawn-brood.sh writes (manifest_version 3). This file is PURE
# EXTRACTION only: it does NOT validate the extracted bytes (that is allowlist.sh's job).
# Every value emitted here is UNTRUSTED and must be re-gated by the caller through the
# matching allowlist value-class validator (identifier / path / presentation) before use.
#
# READ-SIDE INJECTION CLASS IS DEAD BY CONSTRUCTION: the prior YAML read side (sed/awk)
# could not separate YAML STRUCTURE from attacker CONTENT — a hostile `description` block
# scalar carrying counterfeit `status:`/`worktree_path:`/nested `run:` keys or an injected
# `- name:` entry had to be defended against with hand-rolled block-scalar-aware,
# indent-anchored awk. With the manifest as JSON parsed by jq, jq CANNOT confuse content for
# structure: a string field's bytes are just a string, never re-parsed as sibling keys. The
# ENTIRE block-scalar / nested-mapping / multiline-injection class the YAML reader fought is
# gone by construction. The remaining boundary is purely VALUE-shape (allowlist), applied by
# the caller, not structural.
#
# DATA-BOUNDARY: every untrusted value (the strain name the caller searches by) enters jq as
# a --arg binding, NEVER interpolated into the jq program string. An unparseable / torn
# manifest yields no output (jq error swallowed) — the caller treats absent fields as empty.
#
# SINGLE-SNAPSHOT READ (read-side projection path): the projection engine
# (brood-status-project.sh) reads the manifest file EXACTLY ONCE into an in-memory shell
# variable (`content="$(cat -- "$path")"`) and then runs every projection against THAT snapshot
# via jq stdin (`printf '%s' "$content" | jq ...`) — it never re-opens the file. This closes the read-side
# SNAPSHOT-SKEW class: a concurrent write mid-read can no longer make the probe and the per-field
# projections observe different instants. Bytes held in a shell variable and passed only to jq
# stdin are inert — bash does not re-evaluate them as command source. The content-snapshot
# helpers below (suffix `_snapshot` / `_at`) take the CONTENT, not the path; the legacy
# path-based pair (hivemind_manifest_strain_names / hivemind_manifest_field) is retained for the
# unit-test callers that pass a fixture path directly.
#
# MANIFEST SHAPE (mirrors spawn-brood.sh's jq emitter): a top-level object with a `strains`
# array; each strain is an object with `name`, `worktree_path`, `branch`, `tmux_session`,
# `status`, and a nested `run` object carrying `suggested_id` / `suggested_ledger` /
# `workflow_hint`. A v1 manifest (no `run` block) yields empty for the run.* fields.
#
# DEPENDENCY: jq only (POSIX + jq). No yq, no sed/awk YAML parsing.

# hivemind_manifest_strain_names <manifest_path>

# for run.* fields), when the file is absent, or when the manifest is unparseable.
#
# The strain name enters jq as `--arg want`, NEVER interpolated into the program. The field
# is resolved as a dot-path: direct fields read `.<field>`; run.* fields read `.run.<field>`.

# ── Single-snapshot content helpers (read-side projection path) ──────────────────
# These operate on an in-memory CONTENT snapshot the caller read ONCE from the manifest file,
# never re-opening it. The content enters jq ONLY via pipe (`printf '%s' "$content" | jq ...`), never spliced into
# the program; an index enters as --argjson. This is what lets the projection engine open the
# manifest exactly once and run all projections + shape validation against one consistent view.

# hivemind_manifest_validate_shape <content>
# Returns 0 iff <content> is valid JSON AND `.strains` EXISTS and is an ARRAY AND every element
# of `.strains` is an OBJECT. Returns non-zero otherwise (invalid JSON, missing/null/non-array
# `.strains`, or any non-object element). This FOLDS the old `jq empty` syntax-only probe into a
# single shape-validating read: invalid JSON fails `jq -e` here just as it failed `jq empty`, and
# a valid-JSON-but-wrong-shape manifest ({}, {"strains":null}, {"strains":"x"}, {"strains":[1]})
# now ALSO fails — joining the wrong-shape class to the syntactically-invalid class so the caller
# treats both as UNREADABLE rather than silently projecting zero strains. A valid `{"strains":[]}`
# passes (all() over an empty array is true): a legitimate EMPTY brood, NOT unreadable. An element
# that IS an object but lacks `name` still passes shape validation — per-strain field degradation
# (MALFORMED/MISSING tokens) is the existing per-strain contract, not a whole-manifest verdict.
# Emits nothing; pure (no side effects, no exit).
# SINGLE-DOCUMENT REQUIREMENT (root, Codex #172): jq accepts a STREAM of concatenated JSON
# documents, so a non-slurped `jq -e '(.strains|type=="array") ...'` runs the predicate ONCE PER
# document and a file holding TWO valid manifest objects would pass shape validation. The downstream
# count would then emit one length per document (`1\n1`), the loop's `[ "$idx" -lt "$count" ]`
# integer test would error on the multiline value, and the engine would exit 0 with no STRAIN lines
# — live children rendered as an empty brood. We SLURP with `jq -s` and require the slurped array
# length == 1 (exactly one top-level document) AND that the single element is an object with
# `.strains` an array of objects. A multi-document file → length>1 → fails → caller treats it as
# UNREADABLE. The count/field projectors below slurp the same way and index `.[0]`, so the whole
# read operates on one consistent single document.

# `0` on any jq error. The caller drives an INDEX-based loop off this count rather than splitting
# a newline-delimited name stream — so an untrusted field value containing a newline (already
# rejected by the value-class floor, but only AFTER extraction) can never split the loop or forge
# an extra iteration before validation. Pure (no side effects, no exit).

# hivemind_manifest_field_at <content> <index> <field>

# supported fields and the same fixed-jq-path closed-case mapping as hivemind_manifest_field; the
# strain is selected by INDEX (--argjson i), never by a name that could collide or carry a
# delimiter. The field selector is a fixed literal from the closed case below — never attacker
# content.
#
# EXIT-CODE CONTRACT (#178 F2, locked OQ1 resolution — consumed by brood-status-project.sh, STEP-004):
# This helper distinguishes ABSENT from REJECTED via the EXIT CODE, NOT via an in-band sentinel
# string (an in-band sentinel could collide with a legit field value). The caller MUST branch on
# the exit code, not on stdout emptiness alone:
#   exit 0 -> field is PRESENT and VALID. The validated value is emitted on stdout (the caller may
#            still apply its value-class allowlist floor, but the value is string-typed and free of
#            C0 control bytes). Stdout MAY legitimately be a value; it is never empty on exit 0.
#   exit 1 -> field is ABSENT (key missing, JSON null, or empty string). Nothing on stdout. The
#            caller renders MISSING. This is the "nothing to report" case, not an attack.
#   exit 2 -> field is PRESENT but INVALID — wrong JSON type (non-string scalar such as branch:123,
#            tmux_session:true, status:123), a value carrying a C0 control byte, or a multi-document
#            snapshot (length != 1). Nothing trustworthy on stdout. The caller renders MALFORMED.
#            REJECTED is NEVER collapsed into MISSING (exit 1).
# An UNRECOGNIZED field selector exits 1 (treated as absent — it is a fixed caller-supplied literal,
# never attacker content, so a typo degrades to MISSING rather than MALFORMED).
#
# TYPE==STRING GATE (#178 F3): every supported field is a STRING in a well-formed manifest. The
# value MUST be type=="string" BEFORE any extraction/coercion. Without this, jq -r would coerce a
# non-string scalar (branch:123 -> "123", tmux_session:true -> "true") into a trusted-LOOKING token
# that flows past the caller as if it were a real string field. A PRESENT non-string is a tamper
# indicator -> exit 2 (MALFORMED), never coerced and never emitted.
#
# CONTROL-BYTE REJECTION INSIDE jq (root, Codex #172): the caller consumes stdout via $(...) command
# substitution, which SILENTLY STRIPS NUL bytes — so a value validated AFTER the $(...) round-trip
# differs from what jq produced. A JSON   escape is VALID JSON; jq -r decodes it to a real NUL
# that $(...) would erase. jq is the integrity point: it sees the decoded bytes intact, so a value
# matching jq/Oniguruma [[:cntrl:]] (any C0/C1/DEL control byte, NUL included) is rejected -> exit 2
# (MALFORMED), never emitted. NOTE the regex MUST be [[:cntrl:]]: a [\\u0000-\\u001f] range does NOT
# work in jq — jq's JSON string parser decodes \\u to a single backslash+u that Oniguruma treats as
# the printable letter u, so that range silently matches printable text and never a control byte.
# (next line retains the original illustrative bytes; the active gate uses [[:cntrl:]] below.)
# carrying ANY C0 control byte ( -) is rejected -> exit 2 (MALFORMED), never emitted.
#
# SLURP + index .[0] (root, Codex #172): same single-document discipline as
# hivemind_manifest_validate_shape / _strain_count_snapshot — select the strain at $index from the
# ONE top-level document, never from a concatenated stream; a multi-document snapshot exits 2.
#
# IMPLEMENTATION: jq classifies INSIDE the program (while bytes are intact) and emits a fixed
# one-char CLASS tag as the FIRST char of its output: "0"+value (present+valid), "1" (absent),
# "2" (rejected). Bash slices the leading class char and maps it to the exit code; only an exit-0
# value reaches stdout. The class is computed in jq so no untrusted byte ever drives a bash branch.
