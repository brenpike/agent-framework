# brood-status-derive.sh — PURE status-derivation + aggregation library for the brood-status
# collection loop (issue #186, ADR-0020).
#
# THIS FILE IS SOURCED, NOT EXECUTED. No shebang: each caller sources it by absolute path
# derived from its OWN script_dir (`. "$plugin_root/skills/_shared/brood-status-derive.sh"`).
# It defines functions only; it runs no top-level statements and changes no caller state beyond
# defining the functions below. `bash -n` validates it as a sourced fragment.
#
# SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY: turn already-collected per-strain observables (tmux liveness, PR state,
# manifest status) into (a) the rendered Status string, (b) a coarse counting bucket, and
# (c) per-brood / global aggregate counts. EVERYTHING here is PURE arithmetic / string mapping:
# inputs in, string out. There is NO tmux/gh/git/file I/O in this file — the IMPURE probing lives
# in the thin entrypoint (`brood-status-collect.sh`). Keeping derivation pure makes it the primary
# determinism coverage in `tools/test_shared_libs.sh` without standing up tmux/gh/git.
#
# set -u: every parameter is read explicitly; an unset variable is a programming error here. We do
# NOT use `set -e` and there is NO EXIT trap — sourced libraries install neither (ADR-0020).

#
# Ports the SKILL.md rule table EXACTLY. Priority (highest first):
#   1. manifest_status == failed (failed-precedence): a strain recorded failed in the manifest is
#      reported failed regardless of tmux liveness (spawn-brood deliberately leaves the session
#      alive on injection failure for debugging):
#        alive -> "failed (injection failed; session alive for debug)"
#        dead  -> "failed (session ended, no PR)"
#   2. otherwise the tmux x PR observable table:
#        | tmux  | PR     | started-evidence | Status                                    |
#        | alive | none   | yes              | running                                   |
#        | alive | open   | yes              | running (PR #N open)                       |
#        | alive | *      | NO               | starting (session alive, workflow not …)  |
#        | dead  | merged | -                | complete                                  |
#        | dead  | open   | -                | blocked (session ended, PR #N still open) |
#        | dead  | none   | -                | failed (session ended, no PR)             |
#
# <pr_state> is one of: open | merged | none | unknown. `unknown` means the gh probe failed (not
# authenticated / rate-limited). PRESERVE current behavior: an unknown PR is treated like `none`
# for liveness/status derivation (the PR CELL itself is shown as unknown by the renderer; the
# Status derives from tmux + best-known PR). Any unrecognized tmux/PR combination falls through to
# the dead+none "failed" terminal, the conservative default.
#
# <state_current> is the child ledger's `state.current` token as projected by
# brood-status-project.sh — a real workflow-state token, or the fixed sentinels MISSING (a ledger
# pointer exists but the child has not yet written started-evidence), MALFORMED (a present-but-
# rejected ledger), or NO_LEDGER_POINTER (the manifest carries no ledger pointer at all — a legacy
# no-run-block manifest — so started-evidence is STRUCTURALLY unavailable). <run_status> is the
# projected `run.status` token (informational; not part of the started-evidence gate below). These
# are tier-3 child-ledger evidence (informational, never overrides observable status — ADR-0007):
# they only DEMOTE an alive-but-unstarted child away from `running`, never promote to complete and
# never hide a dead session. The demotion applies ONLY when a ledger pointer EXISTS but shows no
# started-evidence (MISSING/MALFORMED/empty). NO_LEDGER_POINTER is the legacy no-pointer
# fall-through: the gate does NOT apply, and the strain derives its observable status (running /
# running (PR #N open)) — preserving ADR-0007's demote-only posture (we never withhold the
# observable `running` claim from a strain that structurally cannot supply ledger evidence).
#
# STARTED-EVIDENCE GATE: an alive session is NOT proof the child
# started its workflow — a pasted-but-never-submitted child has an alive tmux session and no run
# ledger. The ground-truth started signal is RUN-LEDGER EVIDENCE: a present, non-MISSING/
# non-MALFORMED state.current. An alive session WITHOUT that evidence derives the DISTINCT,
# TRANSIENT (non-terminal), non-running, non-complete status below instead of a bare `running`.
# MALFORMED state.current is fail-closed (NOT started-evidence -> demote to starting, not running).
# The gate applies ONLY when a ledger pointer EXISTS but supplies no started-evidence (state.current
# empty/MISSING/MALFORMED). A legacy manifest with NO ledger pointer projects state.current as
# NO_LEDGER_POINTER, for which started-evidence is STRUCTURALLY unavailable: the gate does NOT apply
# (legacy no-pointer fall-through) and an alive session derives its observable status exactly as it
# did before the gate existed. NO_LEDGER_POINTER is DELIBERATELY excluded from the gate's sentinel
# set and is NOT a real workflow-state token — it never leaks into the rendered Status (the non-gated
# alive branch picks running vs running (PR #N open) from pr_for_derive, never from state_current).

#
# Maps the rendered Status string onto the coarse counting bucket the per-brood summary line uses
# ("N of M strains complete. X running. Y blocked/failed."). Classification is by the Status
# string's leading word, which the derivation above fixes to a small closed set:
#   complete                                          -> complete

# running and is NOT counted complete: it falls into blocked_failed alongside blocked/failed so the
# three-bucket summary keeps summing to total with no strain dropped. (A `starting` strain has not
# made forward progress, so counting it against completion is the conservative, sum-preserving
# choice — distinct from `running`, which the started-evidence gate now reserves for genuinely
# started children.) Any unexpected string also falls to blocked_failed (conservative — a strain
# we cannot classify as running or complete is counted against completion, never silently dropped).
