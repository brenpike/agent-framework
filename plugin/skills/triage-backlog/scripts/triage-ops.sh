# triage-ops.sh — deterministic MECHANISM substrate for the hivemind
# `triage-backlog` skill (judgment/mechanism split; engineering-principles P5 +
# P11). Path: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/triage-backlog/scripts/triage-ops.sh
#
# 1. PURPOSE
# ----------
# This script owns ONLY the lossless, deterministic mechanism of issue triage.
# NO rating / judgment logic lives here — choosing a readiness / type / effort /
# moscow / priority / risk / difficulty value for an issue is holistic LLM work
# (P11) and stays in the SKILL prose. The script is the reproducible hands:
#   - bake + idempotently ensure the fixed label palette (name->color->family),
#   - enumerate open issues with their current labels in one call,
#   - apply a rating as labels with PER-FAMILY MUTUAL EXCLUSION (clean reconcile),
#   - read + add NATIVE GitHub issue dependencies (blocked-by) via GraphQL,
#   - surface a GitHub-rejected dependency cycle as a STRUCTURED warning record
#     instead of crashing.
# The split mirrors fetch-normalize.sh: a thin live `gh`/network shell wrapping a
# pure, offline-exercisable transform core.
#
# 2. INPUT CONTRACT — per subcommand
# ----------------------------------
#   ensure-labels
#     args:    none
#     online:  create-or-update every palette label (gh label create --force;
#              idempotent + self-healing color). NEVER deletes any label
#              (foreign labels and triage:locked content are untouched).
#     offline: emits the baked palette JSON; performs no gh call.
#
#   list-issues [--limit N] [--response-file <path|->]
#     online:  gh issue list --state open --limit N
#                --json number,title,labels,body,id   (id = GraphQL node id)
#     offline: re-emits the injected --response-file verbatim (identity), no gh.
#     N defaults to 500. PRs are excluded by `gh issue list` default.
#     NO SILENT TRUNCATION: the skill advertises the ENTIRE backlog, but `gh issue
#     list --limit N` caps at N with no overflow signal. So when the produced
#     row-count EQUALS the requested --limit (cap possibly hit) the subcommand
#     FAILS CLOSED with a diagnostic to raise --limit and re-run (no pagination).
#     The cap check runs UNIFORMLY over the produced rows in BOTH offline and live
#     paths so it is offline-drivable (STEP-002).
#     --response-file is a TEST SEAM honored ONLY when TRIAGE_OPS_OFFLINE is set;
#     a live invocation supplying it is REJECTED fail-closed via the shared guard
#     (see §5) BEFORE any gh call.
#
#   apply-labels <issue-number> --targets <json> | --targets-file <path>
#                                [--current-labels-file <path|->]
#     <json> is a family->value object, e.g. {"priority":"high","type":"bug"}.
#     Only the families PRESENT in the object are reconciled; absent families are
#     left untouched. Every "<family>:<value>" MUST be a managed palette label
#     (validated against the palette — an unknown family/value fails CLOSED).
#     online:  derives current labels UNCONDITIONALLY from `gh issue view` (ground
#              truth); if triage:locked is present it emits a skipped-locked record
#              and mutates NOTHING; otherwise applies the computed delta via one
#              `gh issue edit`. --current-labels-file is a TEST SEAM and is honored
#              ONLY when TRIAGE_OPS_OFFLINE is set — supplying it in the live path
#              is REJECTED fail-closed via the shared guard (see §5) BEFORE any gh
#              call (it could spoof label state, incl. omitting triage:locked to
#              bypass the human-only lock).
#     offline: reads current labels from --current-labels-file (a JSON array of
#              label-name strings) and emits the computed delta JSON; no gh.
#
#   deps-read <issue-number> [--response-file <path|->]
#     online:  gh api graphql — repository.issue(number).blockedBy.
#     offline: normalizes the injected --response-file (a raw GraphQL response).
#     --response-file is a TEST SEAM honored ONLY when TRIAGE_OPS_OFFLINE is set;
#     a live invocation supplying it is REJECTED fail-closed via the shared guard
#     (see §5) BEFORE any gh call.
#
#   deps-add --issue-id <NODE_ID> --blocked-by-id <NODE_ID> [--response-file <path|->]
#            [--issue-labels-file <path|->] [--issue-labels-response <path|->]
#     Operates on GraphQL NODE IDs (from list-issues' `id` field), not numbers —
#     no number->id resolution round-trip is needed because the skill already has
#     the ids. ADD-ONLY: never removes an existing dependency.
#     online:  resolves the GROUND-TRUTH labels of the issue being MUTATED
#              (--issue-id) via a node(id:) GraphQL query; routes the RAW response
#              through validate_response_shape (the SHARED kernel — see §4) so a
#              transport error, .errors envelope, null node, non-array label list,
#              or null/wrong-typed label name FAILS CLOSED before assert_unlocked_live
#              and BEFORE the addBlockedBy mutation — never mutate on unverifiable
#              lock state. A locked issue emits a skipped-locked record and mutates
#              NOTHING (exit 0 — same gate apply-labels uses). Only --issue-id is
#              gated; a locked BLOCKER does not block the edge.
#     offline: with --response-file -> surfaces that injected response (exercises
#              the cycle/error/success records); else with --issue-labels-response ->
#              injects the RAW node(id:) labels GraphQL response and drives the
#              FULL live lock-read path (shared kernel shape gate + lock gate) offline
#              (skipped-locked when locked, payload when unlocked, fail-closed on
#              malformed/error body — exactly what the live path does); else with
#              --issue-labels-file -> injects a PRE-PROJECTED label-name JSON array
#              and drives the lock gate only (bypasses the raw-response kernel guard
#              — use --issue-labels-response to test the kernel guard offline); else
#              -> emits the constructed GraphQL variables payload (exercises payload
#              build).
#     --response-file, --issue-labels-file, and --issue-labels-response are TEST
#              SEAMS honored ONLY when TRIAGE_OPS_OFFLINE is set; a live invocation
#              supplying ANY of them is REJECTED fail-closed via the shared guard
#              (see §5) BEFORE any gh call.
#
# 3. OUTPUT SCHEMA — JSON on stdout (compact)
# -------------------------------------------
#   ensure-labels (offline) / palette:
#     [ { "name": <str>, "color": <hex6-no-#>, "family": <str>, "managed": bool }, ... ]
#
#   apply-labels delta (offline, and the applied set echoed online):
#     { "issue": <int>, "remove": [<label-name>...], "add": [<label-name>...] }
#   apply-labels online, additionally one of:
#     { "issue": <int>, "status": "applied",       "remove": [...], "add": [...] }
#     { "issue": <int>, "status": "skipped-locked" }   # triage:locked present
#
#   deps-read normalized:
#     { "issue": <int|null>, "id": <node-id|null>,
#       "blocked_by": [ { "number": <int>, "id": <node-id>, "title": <str> }, ... ] }
#
#   deps-add payload (offline, no --response-file):
#     { "issueId": <node-id>, "blockingIssueId": <node-id> }
#   deps-add surfaced response (online, or offline with --response-file):
#     added:   { "status": "added",   "issue": <int>, "blocked_by": <int> }
#     warning: { "status": "warning", "kind": "cycle-rejected"|"error"|"transport-error",
#                "message": <str> }
#
# 4. INVARIANTS
# -------------
#   - SINGLE SHARED RESPONSE-SHAPE KERNEL: EVERY live gh/GraphQL read that informs
#     a decision or mutation routes through validate_response_shape before any
#     processing. No per-site hand-parsing of response shape is permitted. A
#     non-clean response — transport error (empty/non-JSON), a non-empty `.errors`
#     envelope, null/missing entity at the expected root path, non-array collection,
#     or a null/wrong-typed field on any element — FAILS CLOSED (nonzero, structured
#     kind record to stderr) before any gate, decision, or mutation. Covered reads:
#     deps-read's blockedBy response (via normalize_deps_read), deps-read's
#     repo-name read (gh repo view — routed RAW through the kernel, no pre-`--jq`
#     projection; an object read wrapped in a synthetic 1-element array to satisfy
#     the kernel's array requirement), deps-add's lock-label node(id:) read (before
#     the addBlockedBy mutation — never mutate on unverifiable lock state),
#     list-issues' gh issue list output (before the cap check and before emitting
#     the backlog), and apply-labels' label read (before the lock gate and before
#     the delta). No subcommand bypasses this kernel — no live read pre-projects
#     before the kernel.
#   - DEPS-ADD LOCK-READ IS PAGINATION-COMPLETE (fail-closed). The node(id:) labels
#     read requests labels(first: 100) with pageInfo { hasNextPage }; the shared
#     kernel's root_pred requires (.labels.pageInfo.hasNextPage // false) == false,
#     so a CONTINUED labels page (hasNextPage == true) FAILS CLOSED (nonzero,
#     malformed-read) BEFORE assert_unlocked_live and BEFORE addBlockedBy — never
#     mutate on a possibly-incomplete labels array whose later page could carry
#     triage:locked. The `// false` default treats an ABSENT pageInfo as complete
#     (clean single-page fixtures stay green), mirroring deps-read's blockedBy idiom.
#     Both call sites (the LIVE node(id:) read and the OFFLINE --issue-labels-response
#     seam) drive the identical predicate so live and offline cannot diverge.
#   - PER-FAMILY MUTUAL EXCLUSION (clean reconcile): for each family in --targets,
#     the delta REMOVES every existing "<family>:*" label that is not the chosen
#     value and ADDS the chosen value if absent. End state: exactly the chosen
#     value in that family. This is minimal-churn (an already-correct value is not
#     removed-and-re-added) yet self-correcting for the conflicting-duplicate case
#     (e.g. a stray second priority:* is removed). Families NOT in --targets are
#     never touched.
#   - NEVER touches triage:locked. It is a human-only control label: the script
#     ensures it EXISTS (ensure-labels) but never adds or removes it, and refuses
#     to mutate any issue carrying it (skipped-locked). "triage" is never a target
#     family, so the mutex prefix match can never select triage:locked.
#   - NEVER deletes foreign labels. Reconcile only removes labels whose prefix is a
#     family PRESENT in --targets and whose value differs from the chosen one;
#     anything outside the seven managed families (incl. initiative:*, wontfix, …)
#     is invisible to the delta. ensure-labels uses create/update only — no delete.
#   - NEVER touches initiative:* (a special case of the foreign-label invariant —
#     this skill is grouping-agnostic).
#   - ADD-ONLY dependencies. deps-add never removes an existing dependency; removal
#     is a human decision outside this script.
#   - deps-add HONORS triage:locked. Before the addBlockedBy write it resolves the
#     ground-truth labels of the issue being MUTATED (the --issue-id NODE ID) via a
#     node(id:) query and gates through the SINGLE shared decision point
#     assert_unlocked_live (the same lock test apply-labels uses, so the two live
#     mutation paths can never diverge). A locked issue is reported skipped-locked
#     and mutated NOT at all; an unverifiable lock state (unreadable/malformed label
#     read) FAILS CLOSED — never mutate. Only --issue-id is gated; a locked BLOCKER
#     does not block the edge.
#   - A GitHub-rejected dependency CYCLE is surfaced as a warning record (kind
#     cycle-rejected) with exit 0 — the script never crashes on it, so a batch
#     keeps going (issues are independent).
#   - Untrusted issue body/title is DATA: it flows only through `gh --json` output
#     and is never interpolated into shell or into GraphQL query source. GraphQL
#     variables are passed via `gh api graphql -f/-F`, never string-concatenated.
#   - FAIL-CLOSED on malformed injected input to a pure transform (bad --targets,
#     unknown family/value, unreadable injection file) — distinct from the review
#     loop's fail-open posture; here a malformed rating is a usage bug, not noise.
#
# 5. OFFLINE TEST SEAM (STEP-002 depends on this)
# -----------------------------------------------
# Set env TRIAGE_OPS_OFFLINE to any non-empty value to make EVERY subcommand skip
# ALL gh/network calls and instead drive its pure transform over INJECTED input,
# emitting the deterministic artifact (palette / delta / payload / surfaced
# record / normalized deps) to stdout. Input that would normally come from gh is
# injected via flags: --current-labels-file (apply-labels), --response-file
# (deps-read, deps-add, list-issues), --issue-labels-file (deps-add — injects the
# label set the live path would resolve by node id, so the lock gate is offline-
# drivable). EVERY fixture/injection flag is honored ONLY when TRIAGE_OPS_OFFLINE
# is set; a live invocation supplying ANY of them is REJECTED fail-closed (exit 2)
# BEFORE any gh call — they are test seams, not live caller payloads, and would
# otherwise spoof state (e.g. omit triage:locked to bypass the human-only lock on
# the deps-add path) or silently no-op a real mutation. This offline-only invariant
# is enforced UNIFORMLY for all four subcommands by the single shared guard
# reject_fixture_flags_in_live_mode (one mechanism, no per-subcommand divergence).
# Use `-` for stdin on any *-file
# flag. The pure transforms are factored as functions reading from injected input
# (compute_mutex_delta, build_deps_add_payload, surface_dep_response,
# normalize_deps_read, triage_palette) so the test can drive each directly via
# the offline CLI with only jq + bash, no `gh`. Mirrors fetch-normalize.sh's
# --payload-file injection.

# requests only the first 50 blockers, so an issue with more than one page would
# normalize as if the unfetched blockers do not exist, letting a re-triage table
# propose bogus dependency removals or re-add an already-existing edge outside the
