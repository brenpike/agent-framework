# rc-brood — deterministic engine for the hivemind:enable-brood-remote skill.
#
# Fans the Claude Code slash command `/rc <strain-name>` (alias `/remote-control`) out to
# every LIVE strain session of one brood via tmux keystroke injection. Each strain's OWN live
# tmux session receives `/rc <its-own-strain-name>`, so each strain self-registers for remote
# control under its strain name. The user invokes this (through the skill) on an EXPLICIT
# natural-language request to enable RC for a brood — it is never an autonomous coordination step.
#
# ADR LINEAGE:
#   - ADR-0007 (fleet children unaware; coordinator is a read-only status dashboard): preserved.
#     Issuing the keystrokes on the user's EXPLICIT request is human-initiated addressing —
#     equivalent to the user attaching to each pane and typing the slash command themselves. It
#     does NOT make the coordinator an autonomous controller; the boundary holds.
#   - ADR-0027 (agent-invocable remote control via description scoping): the capability ships as a
#     normal agent-invocable skill scoped by its description; Claude Code has no in-band peer-drive
#     API (upstream anthropics/claude-code#34243), so external `tmux send-keys` is the only
#     delivery path — the same keystroke-injection mechanism spawn-brood already uses.
#
# INPUT (single positional argument):
#   $1  <broodId> — a brood-id of the EXACT shape spawn-brood generates (`brood-<uuidv4>`,
#       asserted ^brood-[0-9a-f-]+$). Validated as a strict safe single path component BEFORE any
#       use (reject empty / leading-dash / path-traversal / separators / command-substitution /
#       framing bytes). Used to locate the per-brood manifest under the checkout root.
#
# MANIFEST:
#   <checkout-root>/.hivemind/broods/<broodId>/manifest.json  (manifest_version 4, JSON). The
#   checkout root is `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` — the SAME anchor spawn-brood writes against,
#   so read side and write side agree by construction.
#
# OUTPUT (stdout):
#   Per-strain disposition lines (`applied|skipped|failed: <strain> ...`) and a final summary line
#   with applied/skipped/failed counts.
#
# EXIT CONTRACT:
#   0  the fan-out COMPLETED — even with some strains skipped (dead/missing session, unsanitizable
#      name) or failed (a per-strain tmux error). Zero strains / zero alive sessions also exit 0.
#   1  ONLY a pre-flight blocker: bad brood-id, missing/unreadable/invalid manifest, a manifest
#      that FAILS THE SHAPE PREFLIGHT (`.strains` missing/null/object/non-array, or a strain
#      element that is not an object / carries a non-string name or tmux_session), or a missing
#      dependency. No keystroke is delivered on a pre-flight blocker. A wrong-shaped/corrupt
#      manifest is ALWAYS blocked here — never a silent `0 applied` no-op and never object-iterated.
#
# SAFETY (injection invariant — the test asserts this):
#   The ONLY bytes ever sent into any session are the FIXED literal `/rc <short>`, where <short> is
#   the strain's CANONICAL `short` identity — the SAME [a-z0-9-] token spawn-brood derives to name
#   the session (lowercase, REPLACE-map non-[a-z0-9-] bytes to `-`). It is NOT a separate slug: the
#   `/rc` name is the de-duped, work-identifying token, so its uniqueness is INHERITED from
#   spawn-brood's in-set short-collision check (spawn-brood.sh ~500) — two raw-distinct strains can
#   never collide to the same `/rc` name. Untrusted manifest strings (names, descriptions) are read
#   as DATA via `jq -r` and are NEVER interpolated into shell command SOURCE, into a buffer file, or
#   into `send-keys` unsanitized. The RAW `short` is used byte-for-byte (no `tr -s`/trim) so the
#   uniqueness guarantee holds; `short` is already [a-z0-9-]-only (stricter than a command-arg
#   charset), so the literal payload cannot carry framing or control bytes. A strain name that
#   derives an empty `short` is SKIPPED — no malformed `/rc` is ever sent.
#
# TARGET-TRUST (identity invariant — ground-truth-derived pane-id addressing):
#   The tmux session a strain's `/rc` is delivered to is NOT taken from the untrusted manifest
#   `tmux_session` field. Each strain's EXPECTED session is DERIVED FROM GROUND TRUTH exactly as
#   spawn-brood derives it at spawn time — `<brood_id>-<short>`, where `short` is the strain name
#   piped `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -c 'a-z0-9-' '-'` (replicated verbatim from
#   spawn-brood.sh). The manifest `tmux_session` is then a VALIDATED COHERENCE SIGNAL only: it MUST
#   equal the derived identity by EXACT EQUALITY, and any mismatch (sibling, prefix, glob, foreign,
#   or stale) SKIPS the strain — it never becomes the targeting key.
#
#   DELIVERY IS PANE-ID-ADDRESSED (not session-name-addressed) to close a TOCTOU prefix-match hole.
#   tmux resolves a target-PANE name exact-first-then-PREFIX-fallback, so a bare
#   `send-keys -t "$expected_session"` could, if the exact session died/renamed between the liveness
#   gate and the send, prefix-match a same-brood SIBLING (e.g. brood-<uuid>-api vs
#   brood-<uuid>-api-migrations) and mis-deliver the `/rc` payload or its Enter. To eliminate that:
#     - The liveness guard uses tmux's exact-match `=` prefix (`has-session -t "=$expected_session"`),
#       a target-SESSION modifier that forces an EXACT session-name match (no prefix/fnmatch fallback)
#       on EVERY tmux version, to SKIP a dead session.
#     - Immediately before delivery we resolve the active pane id (`%N`) of the EXACT session in
#       target-SESSION context via `list-panes -s -t "=$expected_session"` (the `=` prefix IS honored
#       in target-SESSION contexts on 3.0a), selecting the row whose window+pane active flags == `11`.
#     - BOTH sends address that resolved `%N` pane-id handle. A pane id has NO prefix fallback and
#       ERRORS (`can't find pane: %N`, rc=1) if the pane disappears — so a raced death between resolve
#       and send fails CLOSED into a `failed:` disposition, never silently mis-delivering to a sibling.
#   `=` is therefore used ONLY in target-SESSION contexts (has-session, list-panes -s) that 3.0a
#   honors, and is NEVER used as a target-PANE spec (on 3.0a `send-keys -t "=<s>"` fails with
#   `can't find pane`). A stale/tampered manifest cannot steer `/rc` into a sibling or wrong live
#   pane: the address is a ground-truth-derived pane id, and the manifest value is merely cross-checked.

# ── Holistic manifest-shape PREFLIGHT (fail-closed schema gate, before any fan-out) ─
# CLOSED-BY-CONSTRUCTION: rather than validate each untrusted manifest field piecemeal as a new
# finding arrives, assert the WHOLE manifest shape up front, ONE fail-closed gate, BEFORE projecting
# any entry or probing any session. This makes the entire "wrong-shaped manifest reaches fan-out"
# class unrepresentable past this point — a corrupt/wrong-shaped manifest is ALWAYS a pre-flight
# blocker (exit 1, zero send-keys), never a silent no-op and never an object-iterated mis-run.
#
# What the gate requires (all checked in a SINGLE jq -e pass, so the first violation fails closed):
#   1. the manifest root is a JSON object                       (already guarded above; re-asserted)
#   2. `.strains` is a NON-NULL ARRAY — NOT missing, NOT null, NOT an object, NOT any other type.
#      This is the P1 fix: the former `.strains // []` projected absent/null into an EMPTY brood
#      (silent `0 applied`) and iterated an OBJECT's VALUES (wrong-shaped manifest processed). A
#      non-array `.strains` is now a hard blocker here, so the projection below never sees a shape
#      it cannot handle.
#   3. EVERY strain element is an OBJECT carrying a STRING `name` AND a STRING `tmux_session`.
#      This consolidates the per-field type-strictness that the projection's `reqstr` previously
#      enforced finding-by-finding into the SAME up-front gate. (The projection keeps its own
#      type-strict `reqstr` as defense-in-depth; this gate is now the primary fail-closed boundary.)
# A missing/null `name` or `tmux_session` is NOT rejected here — those remain RUNTIME per-strain
# SKIPS (empty short / no recorded session) below, preserving existing fail-soft behavior. Only
# present-but-NON-STRING fields (and the container-shape violations) are pre-flight blockers.
