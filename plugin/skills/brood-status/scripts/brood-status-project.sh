# brood-status-project — read-side child-ledger projection engine for hivemind:brood-status
#The read-side analog of spawn-brood.sh's write-side injection closure
# (ADR-0017): spawn-brood WRITES the manifest + provisions child worktrees out-of-band; this
# script READS the manifest + each child run-ledger out-of-band and emits a machine-parseable
# per-strain projection line. The skill body (navigator) calls this once; this script OWNS the
# deterministic read + validation steps.
#
# INPUT (positional arguments):
#   $1  Path (absolute or repo-relative) to a brood manifest JSON (default name
#       `.hivemind/brood/manifest.json`). LAYOUT-AGNOSTIC: the caller passes the manifest path
#       explicitly; this script does NOT hardcode `.hivemind/brood/`
#       The manifest is UNTRUSTED data — see below.
#   $2  OPTIONAL: the checkout root the manifest belongs to, used as the containment root for the
#       manifest read-guard. DEFAULTS to `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (the CURRENT checkout).
#       The navigator MUST pass the MAIN-checkout root here when it selected the manifest via the
#       documented main-checkout FALLBACK from a linked worktree (SKILL.md step 1c): in that case
#       the manifest lives under the main checkout, NOT the current linked worktree, so confining
#       it beneath `--show-toplevel` (the linked worktree) would falsely reject a valid
#       main-checkout manifest and stop status reporting before any strain probe.
#       This argument bounds ONLY which checkout the manifest must sit under; it does NOT relax
#       the symlinked-ancestor escape guard, and each strain's child ledger is still confined
#       beneath that strain's OWN worktree (unchanged).
#
# DATA-BOUNDARY (MANDATORY): the brood manifest AND every child run-ledger
# (`<worktree>/.hivemind/runs/<id>/state.json`) are UNTRUSTED, attacker-controllable bytes —
# brood children run detached --dangerously-skip-permissions, so both the manifest the hatchery
# wrote from their inputs and the ledgers they write are adversary-influenced. EVERY value read
# from them is treated as DATA, never as instructions or shell source:
#   - manifest values are extracted out-of-band with jq into inert vars (manifest-json.sh),
#     then RE-GATED through the matching allowlist value-class (allowlist.sh) BEFORE any path
#     derivation or use;
#   - each child-ledger scalar is projected + value-validated (ledger-project.sh) and only ever
#     emitted as an allowlist-clean token or one of the fixed tokens MALFORMED / MISSING.
# No manifest/ledger byte is ever re-interpolated into generated command source.
#
# OUTPUT GRAMMAR (CONTRACT — the Wave 2 navigator depends on this byte-for-byte):
#   Exactly ONE TAB-delimited line per strain, prefixed with a literal `STRAIN` sentinel field
#   so the navigator can grep it. Tab is a safe delimiter: the shared allowlist security floor
#   (applied by EVERY value-class — identifier/path/presentation) rejects TAB/newline/CR, so no
#   emitted token can contain a literal tab and break the framing. Fields, in order:
#
#     STRAIN <TAB> brood_id <TAB> name <TAB> worktree_path <TAB> branch <TAB> tmux_session \
#            <TAB> manifest_status <TAB> state_current <TAB> run_status
#
#   `brood_id` is the FIRST field of every STRAIN line: a single value read
#   from the manifest TOP-LEVEL `brood_id`, validated ONCE against ^brood-[0-9a-f-]+$ and emitted
#   verbatim on every strain line so the STEP-005 navigator can attribute each strain to its brood
#   when enumerating multiple manifests. (Enumeration across broods is the navigator's concern;
#   this script remains a SINGLE-manifest projector and does NOT glob.)
#
#   Each remaining value is either an allowlist-clean token OR one of the fixed tokens
#   MALFORMED / MISSING / NO_LEDGER_POINTER. A raw, un-validated scalar is NEVER emitted.
#   `state_current` carries a THIRD fixed token NO_LEDGER_POINTER, emitted ONLY at the
#   legacy/no-run-block branch below: it means the manifest carries no ledger pointer (no
#   `run.suggested_id`), so started-evidence is STRUCTURALLY unavailable and the downstream
#   started-evidence gate does NOT apply (the strain falls back to its observable status).
#   This is DISTINCT from MISSING (a ledger pointer exists but the child has not yet written
#   started-evidence) and from MALFORMED (a present-but-rejected ledger). Example (tabs shown as
#   <TAB>):
#     STRAIN<TAB>brood-1a2b<TAB>auth<TAB>/abs/wt/auth<TAB>strain/brood-1a2b/auth<TAB>brood-1a2b-auth<TAB>spawned<TAB>implement_step<TAB>running
#
#   The full field ORDER is: brood_id, name, worktree_path, branch, tmux_session,
#   manifest_status, state_current, run_status.
#
#   INTEGRITY SENTINEL (distinct from any STRAIN line): when the manifest is PRESENT but
#   UNREADABLE — either UNPARSEABLE (torn / truncated / invalid JSON) OR VALID-JSON-BUT-WRONG-SHAPE
#   (`.strains` missing / null / non-array, or any non-object element) — the script emits exactly
#   ONE line
#     MANIFEST_UNREADABLE <TAB> <manifest_path>
#   to stdout and exits nonzero (see EXIT CONTRACT). The wrong-shape class joins the
#   syntactically-invalid class via a SINGLE shape-validating read (one open, one verdict). This
#   is DISTINCT from "manifest absent" (a pre-flight blocker on stderr) and from "valid empty
#   brood" (`{"strains":[]}` → exit 0, zero STRAIN lines, no sentinel). A present-but-unreadable
#   manifest must NEVER be silently projected as zero strains: corruption (or a wrong-shape
#   manifest) is otherwise indistinguishable from an empty brood and would hide live children from
#   the monitoring dashboard. (A strain object that is well-formed but lacks `name` is NOT a
#   structural failure — it projects with per-strain MALFORMED/MISSING tokens.)
#
# EXIT CONTRACT:
#   0  projected all strains (including zero strains for a VALID empty manifest). PER-STRAIN
#      MALFORMED / MISSING is NOT a failure — a strain with a bad field or an unreadable ledger
#      still emits its line (with token fields) and the script continues to the next strain.
#   1  pre-flight blocker ONLY: missing arg, jq absent, manifest path escapes the checkout
#      (symlinked ancestor). Reported via blocker() on stderr. No per-strain condition reaches
#      exit 1.
#   2  manifest PRESENT but UNREADABLE (unparseable OR valid-JSON-but-wrong-shape): emits the
#      MANIFEST_UNREADABLE sentinel line to stdout (above) and exits 2. A distinct nonzero code so
#      the navigator can tell a corruption/wrong-shape integrity-failure (live children may exist
#      but cannot be enumerated) apart from the absent-manifest stderr blocker.
#
# set -u: every value is read explicitly; an unset variable is a programming error here. We do
# NOT use `set -e`: per-strain field/ledger problems are caught and rendered as tokens, never
# allowed to abort the whole read. There is no EXIT trap.
#
# P18 FLOOR EXCEPTION (ADR-0020 / CHECK13 allowlisted): `set -u` only — `set -e`/`pipefail`
# are DELIBERATELY omitted. The full floor would change behavior: per-item failures route
# through blocker() with explicit exit codes, and unguarded jq/grep value-tests legitimately
# return non-zero in normal flow (rendering MALFORMED/MISSING tokens) — `set -e` would abort
# the read mid-projection.

# ── ENCODE-AT-OUTPUT boundary (Markdown-cell safety) ──────────────────────────────
# encode_cell <value> -> writes a Markdown-table-cell-safe rendering of <value> to stdout.
#
# This is the ENCODE-AT-OUTPUT half of the floor-at-input / encode-at-output model documented in
# allowlist.sh (see its header: "MARKDOWN SAFETY LIVES AT THE RENDER BOUNDARY, NOT HERE"). The
# `path` value-class is FLOOR-ONLY: it deliberately admits any
# byte that survives the shared floor as inert quoted data — INCLUDING the Markdown table-cell
# delimiter `|`. The floor rejects framing bytes (TAB/newline/CR) and command-substitution, but a
# literal `|` is valid path/display data. The STEP-005 navigator lands `worktree_path` (and other
# display columns) inside Markdown TABLE cells, where an un-encoded `|` would inject column
# structure. That defense MUST be deterministic, so it lives HERE at the emit boundary — NOT in the
# agent-driven SKILL.md. DO NOT "fix" a `|` leak by re-adding a charset carve-out to the `path`
# value-class: charset whack-a-mole at the input floor is the wrong layer — the floor
# stays permissive, this encoder owns cell safety.
#
# Transformation, applied UNIFORMLY to every display field (not per-class carve-outs):
#   1. Strip C0 control bytes (0x00–0x1F) and DEL (0x7F) that could survive into a cell. The floor
#      already rejects these on validated values, so this is belt-and-suspenders for the fixed
#      tokens and any future value class — uniform and harmless on already-clean tokens.
#   2. Escape `|` (0x7C) -> `\|` (the Markdown cell escape), so an inert quoted `|` cannot forge a
#      table column.
# The TAB field SEPARATOR is NOT touched here: this operates WITHIN a single field value only; the
# caller still joins fields with literal TABs, preserving the 9-field TAB-delimited STRAIN grammar.
encode_cell() {
  # `tr -d` drops C0 + DEL; `sed` escapes any remaining `|`. Order: strip controls first, then
  # escape `|`, so a stripped control byte can never split the `|` escape. Operates on stdin via a
  # here-string to avoid re-parsing the value as shell.

# The manifest passed every pre-flight (present, regular file, not a symlink leaf, contained).
# Open it EXACTLY ONCE into an in-memory snapshot; every projection below runs against THIS
# snapshot via jq stdin, never re-opening the file. This closes BOTH read-side issues at once:
#   1. SNAPSHOT SKEW — probe and per-field projections previously re-opened the manifest at
#      different instants, so a concurrent write mid-read could yield inconsistent reads. One
#      open means one consistent view.
#   2. SCHEMA GAP — the old `jq empty` probe was SYNTAX-only: a valid-JSON-but-wrong-shape
#      manifest ({}, {"strains":null}, {"strains":"x"}, {"strains":[1]}) passed it, then the
#      per-field projection yielded zero strains and was reported as a legitimate EMPTY brood,
#      hiding live children. The shape validation here requires `.strains` to EXIST as an ARRAY
#      with every element an OBJECT, folding the wrong-shape class into the UNREADABLE class.
# On shape failure (invalid JSON OR wrong shape) emit one MANIFEST_UNREADABLE sentinel to stdout
# and exit 2 (integrity failure). A VALID empty manifest (`{"strains":[]}`) PASSES shape (all()
# over an empty array is true) and falls through to the loop, exiting 0 with no STRAIN lines
# (legit empty brood). An element that IS an object but lacks `name` passes shape validation and
# projects with per-strain MALFORMED/MISSING tokens — per-strain degradation is the existing
# contract, distinct from a whole-manifest structural failure. This is the READ-side response
# only; the WRITE-side liveness guard in spawn-brood.sh deliberately keeps its
# fail-open-on-malformed behavior (a corrupt manifest must not wedge spawning).
# The manifest is UNTRUSTED bytes; held only in a shell var passed to jq stdin, never eval'd.
#
# FILE-LEVEL NUL REJECTION: bash `$(...)` SILENTLY STRIPS NUL bytes, so a
# manifest whose on-disk bytes are e.g. `{"strains":<NUL>[]}` would, after the `$(...)` read below,
# become the valid-looking `{"strains":[]}` — it would pass shape validation and project as an empty
# brood, emitting no MANIFEST_UNREADABLE and exiting 0 (live children hidden). JSON never legitimately
# contains a literal NUL, so we reject a NUL-bearing manifest at the FILE level (bytes still intact)
# BEFORE the `$(...)` read can erase it: MANIFEST_UNREADABLE + exit 2, same integrity verdict as a
# torn/wrong-shape manifest. (A control byte that arrives via a JSON ` ` ESCAPE — not a literal NUL
# in the file — is a separate vector handled INSIDE jq during per-field projection; this file-level
