# seed-hive — deterministic two-phase entrypoint for the hivemind:seed-hive skill.
#
# THIS SCRIPT IS THE THIN ENTRYPOINT (ADR-0020). It carries the REAL P18 shell-safety
# floor (`set -euo pipefail` + a guaranteed-zero EXIT trap) and COMPOSES the four sourced
# `_shared` libraries, performing NO judgment of its own: it runs no interactive prompt,
# invokes no skill, and makes no detect/headless decision. Those stay in the NAVIGATOR
# (the SKILL.md body / STEP-006): the navigator resolves every tri-state input to a final
# yes/no, then threads the resolved values into this script's APPLY phase. Given those
# inputs the script is PURELY DETERMINISTIC.
#
# TWO PHASES (selected by the first positional argument):
#
#   seed-hive.sh detect <project_root>
#       READ-ONLY companion classifier (SKILL.md Companion Detection). For each companion
#       (caveman@caveman, claude-mem@thedotmack, codex@openai-codex) it determines install
#       state from the installed-plugins manifest via jq → cache-dir fallback → none, and
#       emits ONE JSON object on stdout the navigator consumes to build its confirmation
#       prompt / headless resolution. Mutates NOTHING. Shape:
#         {
#           "companions": {
#             "caveman@caveman":       { "detected": "installed"|"absent",
#                                        "source": "manifest"|"cache"|"none" },
#             "claude-mem@thedotmack": { ... },
#             "codex@openai-codex":    { ... }
#           }
#         }
#       <project_root> is accepted for symmetry with apply (the detection sources are in the
#       user's HOME, not the project); it is validated as a real directory and otherwise
#       unused. The manifest path and cache root honor $HOME (so the navigator's test
#       harness can point them at a tmp HOME via the environment).
#
#   seed-hive.sh apply <inputs.json>
#       DETERMINISTIC mutator. Reads ONE JSON inputs file (authored by the navigator via the
#       Write tool) carrying every RESOLVED value, then composes the four libs to perform the
#       seed and emits the EXACT SKILL.md `## Output` block. The inputs file is the ONLY value
#       on the command line; every field is read with jq into inert shell variables (never
#       interpolated into program source). Inputs JSON shape (authoritative: SKILL.md):
#         {
#           "project_root":   "<required> absolute repo root (the navigator resolves it via
#                              git rev-parse --show-toplevel before calling)",
#           "agent_target":   "<optional> the required agent value; default hivemind:overlord",
#           "caveman":        "yes"|"no",   // RESOLVED (navigator already ran detect+confirm)
#           "claude_mem":     "yes"|"no",   // RESOLVED
#           "codex":          "yes"|"no",   // RESOLVED
#           "seed_allowlist": "yes"|"no",   // default yes
#           "agent_conflict_approved": "yes"|"no", // OPTIONAL, default "no". The navigator sets
#                              "yes" ONLY when re-running apply after the user explicitly approved
#                              overwriting a CONFLICTING existing `agent` value. Threaded as the
#                              7th positional arg into hivemind_settings_merge: "yes" authorizes
#                              the overwrite (merge returns ok → normal complete/updated Output);
#                              any other value / absent → conflict stays blocked. Inert when no
#                              agent conflict exists. NEVER authorizes clobbering a malformed file.
#           // companion detection FACTS (detected/source/via) the navigator gathered, echoed
#           // verbatim into the Output `companions:` block. Optional; absent → reported unknown.
#           "companions": {
#             "caveman@caveman":       { "detected": "...", "source": "...", "via": "..." },
#             "claude-mem@thedotmack": { ... },
#             "codex@openai-codex":    { ... }
#           }
#         }
#
# COMPOSITION (how the four libs are orchestrated in apply):
#   - settings.json: read current (or `{}`), call hivemind_settings_merge, then BRANCH on its
#     IN-BAND `status`:
#       * "conflict"  → the `agent` key already holds a DIFFERENT value. The entrypoint does
#                       NOT overwrite (SKILL.md Merge Rules: needs explicit user approval); it
#                       emits `status: blocked` with the conflict in the Output `conflicts:`
#                       block, writes NOTHING.
#       * "malformed" → the existing settings file is a non-empty unparseable blob. Fail closed:
#                       `status: blocked`, write NOTHING, file byte-unchanged.
#       * "ok"        → write the merged `.settings` back atomically (temp + mv).
#   - file-guards (file-guard.sh): `.gitignore` entries (.hivemind/, .claude/worktrees/) via
#     hivemind_append_if_absent; `.envrc` (caveman=yes) via hivemind_append_env_if_absent; the
#     caveman hook scaffold (caveman=yes) via hivemind_scaffold_hook_file.
#   - claude-mem CLAUDE_CODE_PATH (claude-mem-path.sh, claude_mem=yes) via
#     hivemind_claude_mem_provision_path against $HOME/.claude-mem/settings.json.
#   - test-command detection + `## Validation` append (test-detect.sh) via
#     hivemind_record_validation. test-detect.sh DELEGATES its section append to file-guard.sh's
#     hivemind_guard_validation_section, so file-guard.sh MUST be sourced BEFORE test-detect.sh.
#   - The Output `context_bootstrap: creep-spread: invoked` line is emitted as a CONSTANT — the
#     entrypoint does NOT invoke the skill (that is the navigator's job per SKILL.md step 13);
#     the navigator runs creep-spread around this APPLY call.
#
# STATUS RESOLUTION (SKILL.md Output `status: complete | partial | blocked`):
#   - blocked  → settings-merge returned conflict OR malformed (no settings write happened).
#   - partial  → settings written, but a sub-step degraded into a non-fatal skip that the
#                Output records in `issues:` (e.g. claude_mem_path malformed json). Reserved
#                for the documented degraded outcomes; the common clean seed is complete.
#   - complete → settings written and no degraded `issues:` accrued.
#
# EXIT CONTRACT:
#   0  detect emitted facts, OR apply emitted the Output block (INCLUDING the blocked Output —
#      a settings conflict is a REPORTED outcome, not a script error). The Output `status:`
#      field, not the exit code, carries complete/partial/blocked.
#   2  usage error (unknown/missing phase, missing/invalid argument, jq absent).
#
# P18 FLOOR: this entrypoint carries the FULL `set -euo pipefail` floor (it is an executable
# script, not a sourced library — the sourced libs each document their own CHECK13 floor
# exception). The libs run no top-level `set`, so sourcing them does not perturb this floor.
# INVARIANT: the EXIT trap ends with a guaranteed-zero `:` so a failing trap body can never
# clobber the script's intended exit code.

# written (the merge left the file byte-unchanged). This conforms to the canonical Worker Report
# — Blocked schema (${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/governance/report-format.md, referenced by SKILL.md
# ## Output: "Use the Worker Report — Blocked schema ... for blocked states"): every emitted
# field is a schema-valid token. It carries the agent-conflict cause via a `conflicts:` /
# `existing vs required` line so the navigator can present the conflict to the user, then re-run
# apply with agent_conflict_approved="yes". The out-of-schema `## Output` tokens the prior
# version emitted (`unchanged`, `not invoked`, `not recorded`, `unchanged (settings not
# written)`) are GONE — none are members of any schema enum. The conflict and malformed branches
# remain distinct via the blocker reason. companions_json is accepted for signature symmetry
# with the complete emitter; the blocked report carries no companions block.
