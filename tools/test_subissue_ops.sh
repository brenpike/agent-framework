# Behavioral unit runner for the prd-to-issues MECHANISM substrate (native sub-issues, STEP-002).
#
# OFFLINE jq/bash TEST — CI-runnable with ONLY jq + bash present (NO gh / network / auth). It
# drives the pure transform core of:
#   plugin/skills/prd-to-issues/scripts/subissue-ops.sh
# via its documented offline seam (SUBISSUE_OPS_OFFLINE=1 + the --response-file injection flag),
# feeds canned fixtures from tests/prd-to-issues/, and asserts the emitted JSON equals a golden
# fixture under tests/prd-to-issues/expected/. Each transform (build_attach_payload,
# surface_attach_response, normalize_parent_resolve, normalize_children) is a PURE function of its
# injected input, so every case is deterministic and offline.
#
# Comparison is canonicalized (object keys sorted via -S, arrays deep-sorted) so jq key/element
# ordering can never flake the match.
#
# Mirrors tools/test_triage_ops.sh's pass/fail counter + per-case assertion + helper-fn +
# exit-nonzero-on-any-fail + scratch-tmpdir-on-trap conventions. Read-only: the only writes are
