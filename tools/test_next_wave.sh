#
# Behavior test runner for the READ-ONLY ready-wave engine
# (plugin/skills/next-wave/scripts/next-wave.sh).
#
# The engine takes a BARE run_id positional (never a ledger path), DERIVES the ledger as
# <git-root>/.hivemind/runs/<run_id>/state.json, reads it, and PRINTS a routing decision:
#     all_done: true|false
#     wave: [STEP-00X, STEP-00Y]     # step ids to dispatch this iteration; [] when all_done
#     remaining: <N>                 # count of not-done steps
# It mutates NOTHING (pure read -> derive -> emit). On a validation failure it prints
# `blocker: <reason>` on stderr and exits 1 with nothing on stdout.
#
# ISOLATION (mirrors tools/test_engine.sh's ledger-root pattern): the REAL committed engine is
# run unmodified — it self-locates its own plugin_root (BASH_SOURCE + pwd -P => the real
# plugin/) and sources the real shared containment / ledger-engine-io helpers. Only the LEDGER
# ROOT is faked: each case stages its fixture under a THROWAWAY `git init` checkout so the
# engine's `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` derives the ledger inside that disposable root and
# never touches THIS repo. No FAKEPLUGIN self-location root is needed here (unlike test_engine.sh)
# because next-wave reads NO packaged workflow definition — only the ledger.
#
# Fixtures (tests/next-wave/*.json) are synthetic run-ledger state.json payloads, each crafted to
# exercise one behavior. The harness copies a fixture into the derived ledger path, forcing
# .run.id == run_id for the engine's coherence check (mirroring test_engine.sh's stage helper),
# and optionally overriding .events to simulate wave-advance stages via the DONE-SET derivation
# (union of events[].outputs.completed_steps). Overriding .events in the STAGED copy is a
# harness-side jq mutation (like test_engine.sh forcing .run.id/.run.workflow); it adds NO new
# fixture file — the six tracked fixtures stay the six source payloads.
#
# Assertions:
#   linear   — A->B->C strictly chained: waves of exactly 1 each (today-equivalent serial degrade),
#              and advancement after an event marks STEP-001 done.
#   diamond  — A, then B and C (disjoint) both depend on A, then D depends on B and C. Proves the
#              full lifecycle across simulated stages: wave1=[A], wave2=[B,C] fan-out (with A
#              excluded because a completed_steps event marks it done), wave3=[D] join (done-set
#              UNION across TWO events), wave4=[] all_done. This is the DONE-SET-driven-by-events
#              proof: done-ness comes from events[].outputs.completed_steps, never plan.steps.status.
#   overlap  — two steps with satisfied deps SHARING a file serialize to a wave of 1.
#   glob     — a ready step whose files[] carries a glob metachar is conflicts-with-all: runs ALONE
#              even though a disjoint ready step is available.
#   alias    — a ready step whose files[] carries a `.`/`..` path component (the previously
#              fail-open alias forms) is conflicts-with-all: runs ALONE even though its own alias
#              form and a disjoint ready step are both available.
#   missing  — a ready step with an absent or empty files[] is conflicts-with-all: runs ALONE even
#              though a disjoint ready step is available (under-declared scope can't fan out).
#   cycle    — a dependency cycle is a blocker: exit 1, stderr blocker, ledger byte-unchanged.
#   empty    — empty plan.steps is a blocker: exit 1, stderr blocker, ledger byte-unchanged.
#   epoch    — cross-generation collision closed: after a replan into epoch 2, a prior-epoch
#              (plan_epoch=1) completed_steps credit for the REUSED positional id STEP-001 is
#              IGNORED (1 != current 2), so STEP-001 is re-dispatched this generation; and a
#              SAME-epoch (plan_epoch=2) credit for STEP-001 DOES count, excluding it from the wave.
#              Proves next-wave's done-set is scoped to the current plan.epoch.
#   bad-id   — a plan.steps entry whose .id fails the SAFE_ID_RE charset (a stray `]`) is a
#              blocker: exit 1, stderr blocker, ledger byte-unchanged. Proves the READER-SIDE
#              charset belt (a pre-existing seeded/resume ledger predating the write-boundary
#              guards) stops a malformed id BEFORE it can reach the `wave: [...]` routing emit.
#   shape    — the POSITIVE SHAPE-VALIDATION GATE that runs before checks (a)-(f): a non-object
#              plan.steps entry, a non-array depends_on, a non-array plan.steps, and a
#              missing/non-string .id are each a clean blocker (exit 1, stderr blocker, empty
#              stdout, ledger byte-unchanged) rather than an uncaught raw-jq crash. A further
#              assert_wave case proves the DONE-SET read is type-projected: a malformed
#              (non-object) .events[] element is SKIPPED, not crashed, while a valid
#              completed_steps event alongside it still credits normally.
#
# Every success case ALSO asserts the staged ledger is BYTE-UNCHANGED after the engine runs
# (sha256 before == after) — the engine is read-only.
#
# Prints PASS/FAIL per assertion. Exits non-zero if ANY assertion FAILs.
