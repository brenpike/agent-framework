#
# Behavioral test harness for the CONCURRENT run_suites() in tools/validate.sh
# (issue: validate-suite-speedup, Codex F3 remediation, R-STEP-001).
#
# run_suites() backgrounds each selected suite (`&` + bounded pid pool + wait),
# collects each suite's exit status from a per-job scratch rc file, applies an
# `echo 1` fail-safe when an rc file is missing, computes the aggregate exit
# code, and REPLAYS every suite's report in canonical ALL_SUITES order rather
# than completion order. That surface had NO committed behavioral test — it is
# the highest false-green risk in the dispatcher (a dropped non-zero rc or a
# completion-ordered replay would silently green the merge gate).
#
# This harness exercises the REAL inline run_suites() unmodified. It does NOT
# extract or edit run_suites' production logic. Mechanism (ii): source a copy of
# validate.sh with its source-time `main "$@"` line removed (a sourcing guard —
# the production file is never edited), then override only the INJECTION POINTS:
#   - ALL_SUITES         : the canonical-order array run_suites replays against
#   - run_suite()        : the per-suite executor (stubbed to produce deterministic
#                          pass/fail + sleep-skewed completion order, writing nothing
#                          into the repo tree)
#   - nproc              : pinned for deterministic concurrency (N>1 and N=1 paths)
# Overriding these leaves run_suites' concurrency, wait-based rc collection,
# missing-rc fallback, aggregate-rc, and canonical replay running unmodified.
#
# Assertions target the OBSERVABLE CONTRACT — aggregate exit code + replayed
# report order on stdout — NOT scratch-file internals (out.$i/rc.$i naming), so
# benign refactors of the scratch layout do not break this harness.
#
# CI-runnable with bash only — no jq, no tmux, no network.
#
# Usage:
#   bash tools/test_validate_suites.sh
